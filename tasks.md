- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that transforms dry technical logs into an engaging narrative story, presenting the system's daily operations as a serialized story with characters (agents), plot (tasks), drama (errors), and resolution (fixes)
- **Notes**: Provides an engaging, accessible alternative to raw log reading. Should: (1) Create /story.html page with book/story reader interface, (2) Each day becomes a "chapter" with title generated from main events ("Chapter 47: The Great Disk Cleanup of January 21st"), (3) Agents are characters with personalities: idea-maker is "The Dreamer" who "had a vision for a new feature", developer is "The Builder" who "crafted elegant code", tester is "The Guardian" who "discovered a flaw in the plan", security is "The Sentinel" who "stood watch against intruders", (4) Events transformed into narrative prose: "As dawn broke, the Orchestrator summoned the agents for their morning assembly. First came The Dreamer, bearing a fresh idea for the dashboard..." (5) Dramatic tension from errors: "But trouble was brewing. A syntax error lurked in the shadows, waiting to strike..."

Different from onboarding.html which guides linearly - this allows FREE exploration. Different from ascii-status.html which is text-based - this is VISUAL/spatial. Different from search.html which queries data - this SPATIALLY navigates data. Inspired by video game level design and the ancient art of memory, creates an engaging way to explore complex systems that leverages human spatial memory. Could use Three.js for 3D or CSS transforms for 2.5D isometric view. Makes the dashboard feel less like a spreadsheet and more like a living world.

### TASK-139: Add system "time capsule" and future-self messaging page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page where users and agents can create "time capsules" - messages, predictions, and snapshots sealed for a future date, along with viewing past capsules that have "opened" to compare predictions vs reality
- **Notes**: Provides temporal reflection and long-term tracking through sealed predictions and messages. Should: (1) Create /timecapsule.html page with capsule creation and viewing interface, (2) Create new capsule form: title, message content (markdown supported), seal date (1 day to 1 year in future), optional prediction fields (what will task count be? what will daily cost be? what will uptime be?), snapshot attachment (auto-capture current metrics at seal time), (3) Capsule states: Sealed (locked envelope icon, shows seal date, click shows countdown), Opened (unlocked envelope, shows full content with original timestamp), (4) "Opening ceremony" animation when a capsule's seal date arrives - confetti, sound effect, dramatic reveal, (5) Prediction accuracy scoring: compare predicted vs actual values for metrics, show as % accuracy, (6) Agent auto-capsules: system automatically creates monthly time capsules with current state snapshot and auto-generated "letter from the past" summarizing recent achievements, (7) "Future TODO" feature: tasks you want reminded about later but not now (seal a task idea for 30 days), (8) Timeline view showing capsules on a horizontal timeline - past (opened), present (opening today!), future (sealed), (9) "Reply to past self" - when viewing an opened capsule, option to create a new capsule responding to it, (10) Capsule categories: Prediction, Memory, Goal, Reminder, Message, (11) Share capsule: create public link to an opened capsule for sharing interesting predictions, (12) Search across opened capsules by content or date, (13) Statistics: prediction accuracy over time, most accurate predictor, capsule streaks, (14) Dashboard card with 'U' keyboard shortcut showing next capsule opening date, (15) Notification when capsule opens (integrate with notification system). Different from timemachine.html which shows PAST system states - this creates SEALED MESSAGES to the future. Different from snapshots.html which saves configuration - this seals PREDICTIONS and MESSAGES. Different from journal.html (TASK-136) which logs daily learning - this creates LONG-TERM time-locked content. Different from postmortem.html which analyzes past incidents - this creates FORWARD-looking sealed predictions. Different from achievements.html which tracks milestones - this PREDICTS future milestones. Inspired by actual time capsules and long-term thinking exercises, creates a unique feature that encourages reflection on system evolution over weeks and months rather than just real-time monitoring. Valuable for: "What did we think 6 months ago?" and "Were our predictions accurate?"

### TASK-137: Add system "heartbeat signature" fingerprinting and drift detection page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that captures and visualizes the system's unique behavioral "signature" based on timing patterns, resource rhythms, and agent execution cadences, detecting when this signature drifts from its normal pattern which may indicate compromise, degradation, or unauthorized changes
- **Notes**: Provides behavioral fingerprinting for autonomous system integrity monitoring. Should: (1) Create /signature.html page showing the system's behavioral fingerprint and drift detection, (2) Capture multi-dimensional signature components: cron execution timing variance (how precisely does the 30-min cycle run?), agent run duration patterns (developer typically takes 45-90 seconds), disk I/O rhythm (write bursts every 30 mins), network traffic patterns (API calls to Anthropic at predictable intervals), file access sequences (which files are touched in what order during each cycle), memory allocation patterns (typical RSS per agent), (3) Build a "normal" baseline signature from 7-30 days of operation using statistical profiling, (4) Real-time comparison: current signature vs baseline with drift score (0-100%), (5) Drift alerts when behavior deviates significantly: "Execution timing 40% more variable than baseline", "Developer agent runtime doubled", "Unexpected file access pattern detected", (6) Signature components radar chart showing each dimension's conformance to baseline, (7) Historical drift timeline showing how signature has evolved (drift is expected to slowly evolve with new features, but sudden jumps are suspicious), (8) "Signature lock" mode: freeze baseline and alert on ANY deviation (useful for production stability), (9) Compare today's signature to any historical date ("behavior on Jan 15 vs today"), (10) Potential security application: detect if system behavior changes after a compromise (agent acting differently, unusual file access), (11) Export signature as JSON for external monitoring/comparison, (12) Dashboard card with S keyboard shortcut showing current drift score. Different from anomalies.html which detects metric outliers - this profiles BEHAVIORAL patterns as a holistic fingerprint. Different from config-drift.html which tracks file changes - this tracks EXECUTION patterns. Different from regressions.html which compares output quality - this compares BEHAVIORAL signature. Different from health.html which shows point-in-time metrics - this captures TEMPORAL patterns over complete cycles. Inspired by behavioral biometrics in security (how users type, how systems behave), applies to autonomous AI systems to detect when "something feels different" even if individual metrics look normal. Could catch subtle degradation or compromise that other tools miss.

### TASK-105: Add system entropy and randomness health page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that monitors the system's cryptographic entropy pool health, showing available entropy, consumption patterns, and alerts when entropy runs low (which can cause cryptographic operations to block)
- **Notes**: Provides visibility into a critical but often overlooked system resource that affects SSH, SSL/TLS, and security operations. Should: (1) Create /entropy.html page showing entropy pool status and history, (2) Read current entropy from /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail (Linux provides this), (3) Display current entropy as a gauge (0-4096, green >1000, yellow 200-1000, red <200), (4) Track entropy history over time with line chart showing available entropy at 5-minute intervals, (5) Show entropy consumption events: when does entropy drop suddenly? (correlate with agent runs, SSH connections, SSL handshakes), (6) Display entropy pool size from /proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize, (7) Show hardware RNG status if available (rngd, haveged, or TPM), (8) Alert when entropy drops below threshold (200 bits is considered low for Linux), (9) Explain impact: "Low entropy can cause ssh-keygen, openssl, and random number generation to block or become predictable", (10) Show entropy sources: keyboard/mouse (usually none on servers), disk timing, interrupts, hardware RNG, (11) Backend script stores snapshots in /api/entropy-history.json, (12) Integration with health.html showing entropy as a system health metric. Different from health.html which shows CPU/memory/disk - entropy is a unique security-critical resource. Different from security.html which tracks attacks - this tracks cryptographic health. Different from TASK-081 (anomaly detector) which detects statistical outliers - this specifically monitors the kernel's entropy pool. Different from network.html which monitors network metrics - this monitors the RNG subsystem. Entropy starvation is a real problem on headless servers and VMs that can cause cryptographic operations to hang. This page provides visibility into a resource that most monitoring tools ignore but is critical for server security. The autonomous system generates keys, certificates, and random tokens - knowing if entropy is healthy ensures these operations are secure and don't block.

### TASK-008: Create a user login history reporter
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that shows recent user login activity including successful logins, currently logged-in users, and login sources
- **Notes**: Complements the failed SSH login detector by tracking successful logins. Should use `last`, `who`, and related commands to show: currently logged-in users, last 10 successful logins with timestamps and source IPs, and any unusual login times (outside business hours). Helps with security auditing.

### TASK-010: Create a network connectivity tester
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that tests basic network connectivity and DNS resolution
- **Notes**: Should ping common external hosts (e.g., 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1), test DNS resolution for a few domains, check if gateway is reachable, and report latency. Helpful for diagnosing network issues on the server. Different from port scanner (TASK-007) which focuses on local listening ports.

### TASK-011: Create a crontab documentation generator
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that lists all cron jobs on the system with human-readable schedule descriptions
- **Notes**: Should scan user crontabs (crontab -l), system crontabs (/etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/*), and cron directories (/etc/cron.daily, weekly, monthly). Convert cron schedule syntax to human-readable format (e.g., "*/30 * * * *" → "Every 30 minutes"). Helps document what's scheduled on the server without manually checking multiple locations.

### TASK-012: Create a system reboot history tracker
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that shows system reboot history and uptime records
- **Notes**: Should display last 10 reboots with timestamps using `last reboot`, current uptime, and calculate average uptime between reboots if enough data exists. Helps track system stability and identify unexpected restarts. Complements system-info.sh which shows current uptime but not historical data.

### TASK-015: Create a long-running process detector
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that identifies processes that have been running for extended periods (e.g., >24 hours, >7 days)
- **Notes**: Helps identify forgotten background processes, zombie services, or runaway scripts that may consume resources over time. Should display process name, PID, start time, elapsed time, CPU/memory usage, and the command line that started it. Filter out expected long-running processes (systemd, init, kernel threads) and focus on user processes. Complements memory-monitor.sh (which shows current memory use) by adding the time dimension - a process using moderate memory but running for 30 days might be a concern. Different from service-status-checker.sh which only checks systemd services.

### TASK-016: Create a log file size analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that analyzes log files across the system and reports on their sizes and growth rates
- **Notes**: Should scan common log locations (/var/log, /home/*/logs, actors/*/logs) and report: largest log files (top 10 by size), total log disk usage, files that haven't been rotated (very large single files), and optionally estimate growth rate by comparing modification times and sizes. Different from disk-space-monitor.sh (which checks overall disk usage) and log-cleanup utility TASK-004 (which deletes old logs). This focuses on analysis and visibility rather than cleanup. Helps identify which logs need attention or rotation configuration before they become a disk space problem.

### TASK-017: Create a systemd timer analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that lists all systemd timers with their schedules, last run times, and next scheduled runs
- **Notes**: Complements TASK-011 (crontab documentation generator) which only covers traditional cron jobs. Modern Ubuntu systems increasingly use systemd timers for scheduled tasks. Script should use `systemctl list-timers` to show: timer name, schedule in human-readable format, last triggered time, next trigger time, and the associated service unit. Include both system-wide and user timers. Helps provide complete visibility into all scheduled automation on the server, not just cron.

### TASK-018: Create a swap usage analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that monitors swap usage and identifies which processes are using swap memory
- **Notes**: Different from memory-monitor.sh which focuses on RAM (RSS) usage. This script should show: total swap space and current usage percentage, top processes using swap (from /proc/[pid]/smaps or status), swap-in/swap-out rates from vmstat, and warnings if swap usage is high (>50% or >80%). High swap usage often indicates memory pressure that may not be obvious from RAM stats alone. Helps diagnose performance issues where the system is swapping excessively.

### TASK-020: Create a git repository health checker
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that analyzes the local git repository and reports on its health and status
- **Notes**: Should report: uncommitted changes (staged/unstaged), unpushed commits vs remote, branch information (current branch, tracking status), large files in history that could be cleaned up, stale branches (merged or old), last commit date and author, repo size. Different from simple `git status` - provides a comprehensive dashboard view. Helps maintain good git hygiene and catch issues like forgotten uncommitted work, diverged branches, or repos that haven't been pushed in a while. Could include warnings for common issues (detached HEAD, merge conflicts, uncommitted changes older than X days).

### TASK-030: Add audio/browser notification alerts to CronLoop dashboard
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Add optional browser notification support to alert users when agent errors occur or system health becomes critical
- **Notes**: Enhances monitoring by proactively alerting users to problems. Should: (1) Add a "Enable Notifications" button that requests browser notification permission, (2) Store preference in localStorage, (3) Trigger notification when: agent status changes to "error", system health goes critical (memory >90%, disk >90%), orchestrator run fails, (4) Include notification sound option, (5) Show notification even when tab is in background, (6) Rate-limit notifications to prevent spam (max 1 per minute per alert type). Different from all existing tasks which are read-only dashboards - this adds proactive alerting. Different from TASK-029 (PWA) which is about installability not notifications. Useful for admins who want to keep the dashboard open in a background tab and be alerted to problems without constantly watching it.

### TASK-051: Add cross-event correlation dashboard to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that correlates events across different data sources to surface hidden patterns and potential causation

Should: (1) Create /correlations.html page showing cross-system event relationships, (2) Overlay multiple event types on a unified timeline: SSH attack spikes, system load increases, agent errors, memory spikes, disk writes, (3) Detect temporal correlations - e.g., "SSH attacks from IP X tend to occur during agent runs", (4) Highlight suspicious coincidences - e.g., "Memory spike at 03:00 always follows security agent run", (5) Show heat map of event density by hour-of-day and day-of-week, (6) Allow selecting two event types to see scatter plot of correlation (do they rise together?), (7) Calculate correlation coefficients between metric pairs, (8) Surface anomalies - events that break normal patterns, (9) Natural language summaries of findings (e.g., "High SSH attack volume correlates with 15% higher CPU usage"), (10) Export correlation report as JSON. Different from trends.html which shows single-metric trends - this shows MULTI-metric correlations. Different from TASK-045 (error analyzer) which focuses on errors - this correlates ALL event types. Different from security.html which shows attack data - this CORRELATES attacks with other metrics. Different from TASK-036 (agent analytics) which tracks agent performance - this correlates agents with system-wide events. Helps identify root causes by revealing hidden connections between system events.

### TASK-093: Add focus mode and distraction-free monitoring view to CronLoop dashboard
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a focus mode that presents a minimal, distraction-free view of key metrics for wall-mounted displays, kiosk mode, or users who want simplified monitoring without dashboard clutter
- **Notes**: Provides streamlined monitoring experience for NOC displays or dedicated monitoring screens. Should: (1) Add "Focus Mode" toggle button to main dashboard header (keyboard shortcut 'F'), (2) Focus mode hides navigation, command palette, cards grid, and shows only: large system health indicator (OK/Warning/Critical), current CPU/Memory/Disk as large circular gauges, agent pipeline status (5 dots showing last run status), error count badge if >0, last activity timestamp, (3) Full-screen layout optimized for wall displays or TV monitors, (4) Auto-rotate between 3-4 key views every 30 seconds: System Health, Agent Status, Recent Errors, Cost Summary, (5) Large fonts readable from distance (min 24px base), (6) High contrast mode optimized for projection/large screens, (7) Click anywhere or press any key to exit focus mode, (8) URL parameter support: ?focus=true to launch directly into focus mode (useful for kiosk bookmarks), (9) Configurable metrics: settings page option to choose which 4-6 metrics appear in focus mode, (10) Sound alerts: optional audible beep when status changes from OK to Warning/Critical (respects quiet hours from settings), (11) Current time display in corner (useful for wall displays), (12) Auto-dim after 5 minutes of "all OK" status to reduce screen burn-in. Different from settings.html which configures detailed preferences - this is a RUNTIME display mode. Different from TASK-084 (customizable dashboard layout) which arranges widgets - this provides a SEPARATE minimal interface. Different from health.html which shows detailed metrics - this shows GLANCEABLE status for passive monitoring. Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which is a feature-rich activity feed - this is MINIMAL for ambient awareness. Ideal for: teams with dedicated monitoring displays, home lab enthusiasts with spare monitors, anyone who wants "set and forget" monitoring that alerts them only when attention is needed.

### TASK-112: Add system "voice" narrator and audio status updates page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that provides audio narration of system status using the Web Speech API, allowing users to listen to status updates hands-free while working on other tasks
- **Notes**: Provides accessibility and hands-free monitoring for operators who cannot constantly watch the screen. Should: (1) Create /narrator.html page with audio status controls and transcript display, (2) Use Web Speech API (speechSynthesis) to convert status updates to spoken audio - no external API needed, (3) Configurable announcement types: system health changes (OK->Warning->Critical), agent cycle completions ("Developer completed TASK-105"), new errors ("Security detected 3 new attackers"), cost milestones ("Daily spending reached $5"), (4) Voice settings: speed (0.5x to 2x), pitch, volume, voice selection from browser's available voices, (5) Announcement frequency: immediate (every event), batched (every 5/15/30 minutes summary), on-demand only (manual trigger), (6) Smart filtering: don't announce routine "all OK" status unless specifically requested, focus on changes and alerts, (7) Transcript log showing what was announced with timestamps (for users who had audio off), (8) Text-to-speech preview: type any text to hear how it sounds with current voice settings, (9) Keyboard shortcut to toggle narration on/off globally (e.g., 'N'), (10) Do-not-disturb schedule: auto-mute during specified hours (e.g., 10pm-6am), (11) Priority queue: critical alerts interrupt lower-priority announcements, (12) Integration with existing alert system (alerts.html) - speak triggered alerts. Different from TASK-030 (browser notifications) which shows visual popups - this provides AUDIO output. Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which displays text - this SPEAKS updates. Different from TASK-093 (focus mode) which simplifies visuals - this adds an AUDIO channel. Different from all existing pages which are visual-only - this is the first AUDIO interface. Enables true passive monitoring where operators can listen while coding, walking around the office, or when screen isn't visible. Uses built-in browser APIs, no external services required. Particularly useful for accessibility (visually impaired users) and NOC environments where eyes may be elsewhere.

### TASK-152: Add automated "Sprint Retrospective" and weekly review page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that auto-generates structured sprint retrospectives analyzing the past week/month's performance, identifying what went well, what didn't, and actionable improvements - mimicking an agile team's retrospective ceremony but for an autonomous AI system
- **Notes**: Provides periodic structured reflection to drive continuous improvement. Should: (1) Create /retrospective.html page with sprint review interface, (2) Auto-generate weekly retrospectives every Sunday at midnight by analyzing the past 7 days of data, (3) "What Went Well" section: tasks completed successfully, highest success rate agents, features deployed without issues, cost savings achieved, uptime achievements, (4) "What Didn't Go Well" section: failed tasks with root causes, agents that struggled (high error rates), recurring issues that appeared multiple times, budget overruns, performance regressions detected, (5) "Action Items" section: AI-generated specific improvements based on patterns - e.g., "Developer agent failed 3 times on TypeScript tasks - consider adding TypeScript-specific instructions to prompt", (6) Metrics comparison: this week vs last week showing improvement/regression arrows, (7) "Team Member Spotlight" highlighting the agent that performed best this week with stats, (8) "Challenge of the Week" identifying the hardest problem that was solved, (9) Historical retrospective archive: browse past weeks/months, (10) Trend analysis: are retrospectives getting better or worse over time? (track action item completion rate), (11) Generate retrospective on-demand for custom date ranges, (12) Export as PDF/markdown for sharing, (13) Dashboard card with 'R' keyboard shortcut showing days until next retrospective. Different from journal.html (TASK-136) which captures daily learnings - this provides WEEKLY structured analysis with specific improvement recommendations. Different from changelog.html which lists what changed - this EVALUATES whether changes were good or bad. Different from digest.html which summarizes metrics - this provides ACTIONABLE retrospective with improvement items. Different from analytics.html which shows raw data - this interprets data through an AGILE retrospective lens. Different from postmortem.html which analyzes specific incidents - this reviews the ENTIRE week/sprint holistically. Inspired by agile scrum ceremonies - brings disciplined retrospection to autonomous systems. Closes the improvement loop by generating specific action items that other agents can implement.
