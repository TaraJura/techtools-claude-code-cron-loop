Should: (1) Create /decision-theater.html page with theatrical aesthetic (stage curtains, spotlight effects, dramatic typography, scene cards), (2) Capture decision moments from agent logs: task assignment choices (PM choosing between developer/developer2), triage decisions (which task to work on first), implementation approaches (when multiple solutions were possible), error handling choices (retry vs fail vs skip), (3) Each decision scene includes: timestamp, agent "actor", the dilemma faced, options considered (Option A, B, C...), factors weighed (priority, complexity, dependencies, time), the chosen path with reasoning, outcome summary (did the choice work out?), (4) "Replay" mode: step through the decision process like a slow-motion replay with dramatic pause at the choice point, (5) "What if?" overlay: show what would have been different if alternate choice was made (based on heuristics), (6) Decision categories: Resource Allocation (which task gets attention), Technical Approach (how to implement), Conflict Resolution (when agents disagree), Priority Call (urgent vs important), Risk Assessment (safe vs fast), (7) "Turning point" detection: automatically identify decisions that had outsized impact on subsequent outcomes, (8) Decision timeline showing all major choice points chronologically with branching visualization, (9) Agent "acting style" analysis: does this agent tend toward cautious or bold choices?, (10) "Director's commentary" mode: AI-generated explanation of why this decision mattered in the bigger picture, (11) "Critics' review": rate decisions in hindsight (genius/reasonable/questionable/regrettable), (12) Share memorable decisions as dramatic scene cards, (13) "Season finale" section highlighting the most consequential decisions of the week/month, (14) Dashboard card with masks/theater emoji and 'T' keyboard shortcut, (15) Command palette entry. Different from decisions.html which shows current PENDING decisions - this replays PAST decisions dramatically. Different from thinking.html which shows REASONING process - this dramatizes the CHOICE MOMENT specifically. Different from alternate-timeline.html (TASK-150) which explores hypotheticals - this focuses on ACTUAL decisions with theatrical presentation. Different from postmortem.html which analyzes INCIDENTS - this captures ALL significant decisions, not just failures. Different from journal.html which logs LEARNINGS - this spotlights PIVOTAL MOMENTS. Inspired by sports replay analysis and courtroom drama - makes the invisible deliberation process visible and engaging. Unique value: shows that autonomous systems constantly make choices (not just execute), humanizes the decision-making process, provides training data for understanding what factors lead to good decisions.

### TASK-194: Add system "commit poet" and commit message quality analyzer page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that analyzes the quality, style, and consistency of commit messages across the autonomous system's git history - scoring messages on clarity, informativeness, and adherence to conventions, identifying patterns, and providing insights into how well the system documents its own changes through commit messages.
- **Notes**: Commit messages are the system's primary documentation of what it did and why. Should: (1) Create /commit-poet.html page with writing/editing aesthetic (typewriter fonts, manuscript paper texture, red editing marks, writing desk imagery), (2) Commit message quality score (0-100) based on: length (not too short, not too long), presence of context (why, not just what), verb tense consistency, clarity of language, actionable information, (3) Convention compliance: check if messages follow common patterns (imperative mood, 50-char subject line limit, blank line before body, etc.), (4) "Hall of Fame" section: best commit messages ranked by quality score with explanation of why they're good, (5) "Hall of Shame" section: worst commit messages with suggestions for improvement (educational, not punitive), (6) Agent comparison: which agents write the best commit messages? Leaderboard by average quality score, (7) Trend analysis: is commit message quality improving or degrading over time?, (8) Word frequency analysis: most common words/phrases in commits, identifying clichés ("fix bug", "update file") vs descriptive messages, (9) "Commit poetry" feature: find commits that accidentally rhyme, have interesting rhythm, or read as haiku (fun easter egg), (10) Message length distribution: histogram of commit message lengths with ideal range highlighted, (11) "Missing context" detector: commits that say WHAT changed but not WHY (red flag for future archaeology), (12) Semantic categorization: automatically tag commits as feature/fix/refactor/docs/chore based on message content, (13) Co-author attribution tracking: analyze Co-Authored-By patterns, (14) "Write like this" examples: generate good commit message templates based on high-scoring historical messages, (15) Export report: generate a commit message style guide based on analyzed patterns, (16) Dashboard card with quill/pen emoji and 'M' keyboard shortcut (M for Message), (17) Command palette entry. Different from git-health.html which analyzes REPOSITORY health metrics - this analyzes MESSAGE content quality. Different from blame-map.html (TASK-179) which shows WHO changed WHAT - this analyzes HOW changes are described. Different from changelog.html which DISPLAYS commit history - this ANALYZES commit message quality. Different from diffs.html which shows code CHANGES - this analyzes commit MESSAGE text. Different from echo-profile.html (TASK-191) which analyzes agent VOICE patterns broadly - this specifically focuses on COMMIT MESSAGE quality. Different from fossil-record.html (TASK-174) which tracks DELETED code - this tracks how code changes are DOCUMENTED. Inspired by commit message linters (commitlint), conventional commits specification, and the idea that good commit messages are a form of documentation. Unique value: helps the autonomous system write better commit messages over time by learning from its own best practices. For an AI system that documents itself, commit message quality directly affects future AI's ability to understand past changes.

### TASK-201: Add system "mirror dimension" and parallel instance comparison page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that enables comparison between this CronLoop instance and hypothetical "parallel universe" versions of itself - simulating what the system would look like with different initial configurations, different agent counts, different cron schedules, or different prompts - allowing operators to understand if their current instance is optimal or if alternate configurations might perform better.
- **Notes**: Provides configuration optimization insights through parallel simulation comparison. Should: (1) Create /mirror.html page with multiverse aesthetic (portal visuals, dimensional rifts, mirror reflections, parallel timeline imagery), (2) "Current reality" baseline showing this instance's key metrics: task completion rate, cost per task, error rate, uptime, agent efficiency, (3) "Create parallel universe" configurator: select which parameter to vary - agents (what if 4 agents instead of 6?), schedule (what if 15-min cron instead of 30?), prompts (what if stricter/looser constraints?), budget (what if 2x token budget?), (4) Simulation engine that estimates what metrics would be in the alternate configuration based on heuristics: more agents = faster throughput but higher costs, faster cron = more tasks but more token spend, (5) Side-by-side comparison: current reality vs simulated parallel universe with delta indicators (better/worse/same), (6) "Optimal configuration finder" mode: automatically simulate multiple configurations and rank them by user-selected goal (minimize cost, maximize throughput, balance both), (7) "What if history" section: if we had started with this alternate config, what would our cumulative metrics be by now?, (8) "Dimensional stability" warnings: flag configurations that might cause instability (too many agents competing, too fast cron causing overlap), (9) "Merge realities" feature: generate a migration plan if the alternate configuration is clearly better, (10) Save and compare multiple parallel universe scenarios, (11) "Multiverse leaderboard" showing how this instance ranks against its own parallel possibilities, (12) Share interesting parallel universe comparisons as reports, (13) Historical tracking: how has our "optimal configuration" evolved as the system grew?, (14) Dashboard card with portal/mirror emoji and 'D' keyboard shortcut (D for Dimension), (15) Command palette entry. Different from alternate-timeline.html (TASK-150) which explores past DECISIONS that were made - this simulates CONFIGURATION changes that could be made now or in the future. Different from sandbox.html which tests INDIVIDUAL changes - this compares ENTIRE system configurations. Different from capacity.html which forecasts RESOURCE needs - this compares STRUCTURAL alternatives. Different from benchmarks.html which measures current PERFORMANCE - this estimates HYPOTHETICAL performance under different configs. Different from forecast.html which predicts METRICS - this simulates CONFIGURATION impacts. Inspired by the multiverse concept in physics and gaming (what-if simulators), helps operators understand if their autonomous system is configured optimally or if adjustments could improve performance. Unique value for autonomous systems: provides data-driven guidance on system tuning without requiring actual experimentation, reducing risk of destabilizing changes. Answers "is this the best version of our system, or could it be better?"

### TASK-207: Add system "stock exchange" and metric trading floor page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that reimagines system metrics as stocks on a trading floor, where each metric (task completion rate, error rate, token costs, uptime, etc.) is treated as a "stock" with real-time price movement based on performance. Users can "watch" or "invest attention" in different metrics, see historical price charts, track market trends, and receive "analyst reports" on which metrics are bullish or bearish.
- **Notes**: Applies financial market metaphors to make metric monitoring intuitive and engaging. Should: (1) Create /exchange.html page with stock exchange aesthetic (ticker tape displays, trading floor visuals, green/red price movements, stock ticker boards), (2) Core concept: convert each key metric into a "stock" where current value maps to "price" - uptime at 99.9% = price of $999, task completion at 95% = $95, etc., (3) "Market index" composite showing overall system health as a single index value (like S&P 500 for the system), (4) Real-time ticker tape scrolling across top showing metric changes as price movements with up/down arrows and percentage change, (5) "Stock charts" for each metric showing candlestick or line graphs of historical performance (1H, 1D, 1W, 1M views), (6) "Bull/Bear indicators" for each metric based on trend direction - green bull when improving, red bear when declining, (7) "Trading volume" showing activity level - how often this metric changes/updates, (8) "Watchlist" feature: users can create custom watchlists of metrics they care about most, (9) "Portfolio performance" summary: if you were "invested" in these metrics, how would your portfolio be doing?, (10) "Market news" section: significant metric changes announced as breaking financial news ("UPTIME surges 2% on improved infrastructure!"), (11) "Analyst ratings" AI-generated assessment of each metric's outlook (Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Sell/Strong Sell), (12) "Dividend" concept: metrics that consistently perform well "pay dividends" (contribute to stability), (13) "IPO" section for new metrics being tracked (recently added monitoring), (14) "Delisted" section for deprecated metrics, (15) Sound effects: trading floor ambience, bell sounds for market open/close (cron cycle start/end), (16) Dashboard card with chart/money emoji and '$' keyboard shortcut, (17) Command palette entry. Different from analytics.html which shows raw METRICS - this gamifies them as STOCKS. Different from trends.html which shows trend LINES - this uses financial METAPHORS. Different from forecast.html which predicts VALUES - this presents as market SPECULATION. Different from budget.html which tracks real SPENDING - this tracks performance as metaphorical VALUE. Different from leaderboard.html which compares AGENTS - this compares METRICS as competing stocks. Inspired by: stock market tickers, financial dashboards, gamification of data. Unique value: makes metrics feel consequential and dynamic rather than static numbers, leverages users' intuition about markets to understand system health trends.

### TASK-208: Add system "construction site" and feature building progress page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that visualizes the autonomous system's ongoing development as a construction site, where features in development are shown as buildings under construction with scaffolding, cranes, and progress indicators. Shows the "city skyline" of completed features versus active construction zones, with hard-hat worker animations representing active agents.
- **Notes**: Provides an intuitive construction/building metaphor for feature development tracking. Should: (1) Create /construction.html page with construction site aesthetic (blueprint textures, safety yellow/black stripes, crane animations, hard hat imagery), (2) "Skyline view" showing completed features as finished buildings of various heights (complexity = height, importance = width), (3) "Construction zones" showing in-progress tasks with scaffolding, cranes, and partial building structures, (4) "Workers on site" animated icons representing which agents are currently active and what they're building, (5) Progress bars for each construction project shown as building floors being completed from ground up, (6) "Foundation" phase when task is assigned but not started (ground broken), (7) "Framing" phase when implementation begins (skeleton structure visible), (8) "Finishing" phase when testing/verification (windows being installed, paint going on), (9) "Ribbon cutting" animation when task is verified complete (grand opening ceremony), (10) "Demolition zone" for deprecated features being removed (wrecking ball animation), (11) "City planning" overview showing the master plan vs current state (roadmap as city blueprint), (12) "Permits pending" section for backlog tasks awaiting assignment (permit office queue), (13) "Inspector on site" when tester is verifying (hard-hat figure with clipboard), (14) "Safety record" tracking: days since last failure incident displayed as construction site safety sign, (15) "Crane activity" visualization: show resource usage as crane movements (tokens lifted, files moved), (16) Time-lapse mode: watch the city grow over time from first commit to present, (17) Night mode: construction site with work lights for overnight cron runs, (18) Sound effects: optional construction ambience (hammering, machinery hum), (19) Dashboard card with construction/building emoji and 'B' keyboard shortcut, (20) Command palette entry. Different from architecture.html which shows technical DEPENDENCIES - this shows feature DEVELOPMENT as physical construction. Different from genealogy.html (TASK-142) which shows code EVOLUTION tree - this shows BUILDING progress. Different from task-graph.html which shows task RELATIONSHIPS - this shows task BUILDING progress visually. Different from timeline.html which shows linear TIME progression - this shows SPATIAL building metaphor. Different from activity-calendar.html which tracks calendar EVENTS - this tracks construction PROGRESS. Different from skill-tree.html which shows RPG SKILLS - this uses CONSTRUCTION metaphor. Inspired by: SimCity city building, construction project management dashboards, the satisfying visual of watching something being built. Unique value: makes the often abstract concept of "feature development" tangible and visually satisfying, letting users see their autonomous system literally building itself brick by brick.
