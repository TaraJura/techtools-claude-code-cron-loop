### TASK-196: Add system "decision theater" and critical choice replay page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that captures and dramatizes the system's critical decision moments - those pivotal instances when agents faced multiple options and had to commit to a path, showing the alternatives that were considered, the factors that tipped the balance, and allowing users to "replay" the decision-making process like watching a dramatic scene unfold in slow motion.
- **Notes**: Surfaces the invisible decision-making process of autonomous agents. Should: (1) Create /decision-theater.html page with theatrical aesthetic (stage curtains, spotlight effects, dramatic typography, scene cards), (2) Capture decision moments from agent logs: task assignment choices (PM choosing between developer/developer2), triage decisions (which task to work on first), implementation approaches (when multiple solutions were possible), error handling choices (retry vs fail vs skip), (3) Each decision scene includes: timestamp, agent "actor", the dilemma faced, options considered (Option A, B, C...), factors weighed (priority, complexity, dependencies, time), the chosen path with reasoning, outcome summary (did the choice work out?), (4) "Replay" mode: step through the decision process like a slow-motion replay with dramatic pause at the choice point, (5) "What if?" overlay: show what would have been different if alternate choice was made (based on heuristics), (6) Decision categories: Resource Allocation (which task gets attention), Technical Approach (how to implement), Conflict Resolution (when agents disagree), Priority Call (urgent vs important), Risk Assessment (safe vs fast), (7) "Turning point" detection: automatically identify decisions that had outsized impact on subsequent outcomes, (8) Decision timeline showing all major choice points chronologically with branching visualization, (9) Agent "acting style" analysis: does this agent tend toward cautious or bold choices?, (10) "Director's commentary" mode: AI-generated explanation of why this decision mattered in the bigger picture, (11) "Critics' review": rate decisions in hindsight (genius/reasonable/questionable/regrettable), (12) Share memorable decisions as dramatic scene cards, (13) "Season finale" section highlighting the most consequential decisions of the week/month, (14) Dashboard card with masks/theater emoji and 'T' keyboard shortcut, (15) Command palette entry.

Different from alternate-timeline.html (TASK-150) which explores hypotheticals - this focuses on ACTUAL decisions with theatrical presentation. Different from postmortem.html which analyzes INCIDENTS - this captures ALL significant decisions, not just failures. Different from journal.html which logs LEARNINGS - this spotlights PIVOTAL MOMENTS. Inspired by sports replay analysis and courtroom drama - makes the invisible deliberation process visible and engaging. Unique value: shows that autonomous systems constantly make choices (not just execute), humanizes the decision-making process, provides training data for understanding what factors lead to good decisions.

### TASK-194: Add system "commit poet" and commit message quality analyzer page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW

Should: (1) Create /rubber-duck.html page with whimsical rubber duck aesthetic (yellow accents, bath/water imagery, duck avatar, speech bubbles), (2) Chat-style interface where user describes the problem they're debugging, (3) Duck responses are Socratic: asks "what have you tried?", "when did this start?", "what changed recently?", rather than giving answers, (4) Context-aware suggestions: based on keywords in user description, suggest relevant pages to check (mention "memory" → suggest /memory.html, mention "agent" → suggest /agents.html), (5) Debugging checklist generator: based on problem category, generate a checklist of things to verify, (6) "What changed?" helper: automatically show recent commits, config changes, and deployments that might be relevant, (7) Problem categories: Performance issue, Agent failure, Security concern, Build/deploy problem, Unknown/general, (8) Timer tracking: how long user has been debugging (encourages taking breaks), (9) "Aha moment" button: user can log when they find the solution, with notes on what helped, (10) Common pitfalls database: surface known gotchas based on problem type ("When debugging memory issues, don't forget to check swap..."), (11) Link to relevant playbooks when problem matches known patterns, (12) Session history: past debugging sessions saved for reference, (13) "Quack" button: motivational duck quack sound effect (optional, fun easter egg), (14) Export debugging session as markdown for postmortem documentation, (15) Dashboard card with duck emoji and 'K' keyboard shortcut (K for Quack/Duck), (16) Command palette entry. Different from chat.html which may provide GENERAL chat - this is specifically for DEBUGGING methodology. Different from playbooks.html which provides SOLUTIONS - this helps users FIND solutions themselves through guided questioning. Different from debug.html which shows DEBUG DATA - this is a CONVERSATIONAL debugging companion. Different from root-cause.html which ANALYZES past incidents - this GUIDES current investigation. Different from postmortem.html which documents AFTER resolution - this assists DURING debugging. Inspired by: the rubber duck debugging technique (explaining problems to an inanimate object to find solutions), pair programming, and Socratic method. Unique value: helps operators develop better debugging habits while pointing them to relevant system data, without creating dependency on AI solving their problems. The playful duck theme makes frustrating debugging sessions more bearable.

Different from alternate-timeline.html (TASK-150) which explores past DECISIONS that were made - this simulates CONFIGURATION changes that could be made now or in the future. Different from sandbox.html which tests INDIVIDUAL changes - this compares ENTIRE system configurations. Different from capacity.html which forecasts RESOURCE needs - this compares STRUCTURAL alternatives. Different from benchmarks.html which measures current PERFORMANCE - this estimates HYPOTHETICAL performance under different configs. Different from forecast.html which predicts METRICS - this simulates CONFIGURATION impacts. Inspired by the multiverse concept in physics and gaming (what-if simulators), helps operators understand if their autonomous system is configured optimally or if adjustments could improve performance. Unique value for autonomous systems: provides data-driven guidance on system tuning without requiring actual experimentation, reducing risk of destabilizing changes. Answers "is this the best version of our system, or could it be better?"
