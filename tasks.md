Should: (1) Create /cascade.html page showing failure propagation analysis, (2) Map the agent dependency chain: idea-maker -> PM -> developer -> tester -> security, and how data flows between them, (3) For each historical agent failure, trace downstream impact: if developer failed, was tester blocked? If PM produced incomplete spec, did developer fail?, (4) Visualize as a flow diagram with red highlighted paths showing failure propagation, (5) Calculate "blast radius" metrics: when agent X fails, what percentage of time does it cause downstream failures?, (6) Identify resilient vs fragile handoffs: which agent transitions have highest failure correlation?, (7) Show recovery time: how long until pipeline resumes normal operation after failure?, (8) Detect cascade patterns: does idea-maker failure ever cause developer failure 2 cycles later?, (9) "What if" simulation: if developer were unavailable for 24 hours, what would happen to task throughput?, (10) Recommendations: surface which agents need better error handling or graceful degradation, (11) Historical cascade timeline: show past cascade events with root cause and total impact, (12) Export failure analysis as JSON for postmortem integration with TASK-078.

Different from trends.html which shows single-metric trends - this shows MULTI-metric correlations. Different from TASK-045 (error analyzer) which focuses on errors - this correlates ALL event types. Different from security.html which shows attack data - this CORRELATES attacks with other metrics. Different from TASK-036 (agent analytics) which tracks agent performance - this correlates agents with system-wide events. Helps identify root causes by revealing hidden connections between system events.

### TASK-069: Add data retention dashboard page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that visualizes data accumulation across all JSON files, logs, and caches, showing storage growth trends and providing cleanup recommendations
- **Notes**: Provides data hygiene visibility for the autonomous system that runs 24/7 and accumulates logs/metrics continuously. Should: (1) Create /retention.html page showing data storage analysis, (2) Scan all data directories: /api/*.json (API data files), actors/*/logs/*.log (agent logs), logs/*.log (system logs), /var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/logs/ (web logs), (3) Display table showing: file/directory, current size, growth rate (MB/day calculated from historical data), oldest entry date, retention policy (if any), (4) Calculate total data footprint and project when disk will fill at current growth rate, (5) Show timeline chart of data growth over past 30 days, (6) Identify "data hoarders": files growing fastest or unusually large, (7) Auto-suggest retention policies: "changelog.json is 104KB and growing - consider archiving entries >30 days", (8) One-click archive action: move old entries to gzipped archive files, (9) Show JSON file entry counts (how many items in each array) not just byte sizes, (10) Deletion safety: preview what would be removed before any cleanup action, (11) Store retention snapshots in /api/retention-history.json for trend analysis. Different from TASK-016 (log file size analyzer script) which is CLI-only - this provides WEB visualization with actionable cleanup. Different from TASK-004 (log cleanup utility) which does automatic deletion - this provides VISIBILITY and RECOMMENDATIONS first. Different from health.html which shows current disk usage - this shows DATA GROWTH TRENDS and RETENTION analysis. Helps prevent the "boiling frog" problem where data slowly accumulates until disk is full, by providing early warning and recommendations.


### TASK-091: Add system resource prediction page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a page that predicts future resource exhaustion (disk full, memory pressure, log overflow) based on current growth trends and usage patterns, providing proactive capacity planning insights
- **Notes**: Provides predictive capacity planning to prevent outages before they happen. Should: (1) Create /capacity.html page showing resource exhaustion predictions, (2) Analyze historical data from metrics-history.json to calculate growth rates for: disk usage (bytes/day), memory baseline (trending up?), log file growth (from logs-index.json sizes), JSON data file growth (api/*.json total size), agent execution frequency and duration trends, (3) Calculate "days until exhaustion" for each resource: disk (when will / reach 95%?), log storage (when will actors/*/logs exceed 1GB?), API data (when will /api/ JSON files need archival?), (4) Display as a capacity forecast timeline showing predicted exhaustion dates, (5) Visual "runway" indicators: green (>30 days), yellow (7-30 days), red (<7 days until exhaustion), (6) Factor in seasonal patterns: are weekends different? Is there a monthly cycle?, (7) Model best-case and worst-case scenarios based on variance in growth rates, (8) Provide actionable recommendations: "At current rate, disk will be full in 45 days. Consider: archiving old logs, enabling log rotation, or expanding disk.", (9) What-if calculator: "If we reduce log retention to 3 days, runway extends to 90 days", (10) Alert integration: tie into TASK-073 alert rules builder if implemented, (11) Historical accuracy tracking: compare past predictions to actual outcomes to improve model, (12) Export capacity report as PDF or JSON for stakeholder review. Different from forecast.html which predicts METRIC VALUES (CPU will be X%) - this predicts EXHAUSTION DATES (disk will be FULL on DATE). Different from TASK-069 (data retention dashboard) which shows current data sizes - this PROJECTS FUTURE exhaustion. Different from health.html which shows current resource state - this shows when resources will FAIL. Different from TASK-081 (anomaly detector) which detects current unusual values - this predicts FUTURE capacity problems. Brings proactive capacity planning to the autonomous system - instead of reacting to "disk full" errors, administrators can see problems coming weeks in advance and plan accordingly.

### TASK-093: Add focus mode and distraction-free monitoring view to CronLoop dashboard
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a focus mode that presents a minimal, distraction-free view of key metrics for wall-mounted displays, kiosk mode, or users who want simplified monitoring without dashboard clutter
- **Notes**: Provides streamlined monitoring experience for NOC displays or dedicated monitoring screens. Should: (1) Add "Focus Mode" toggle button to main dashboard header (keyboard shortcut 'F'), (2) Focus mode hides navigation, command palette, cards grid, and shows only: large system health indicator (OK/Warning/Critical), current CPU/Memory/Disk as large circular gauges, agent pipeline status (5 dots showing last run status), error count badge if >0, last activity timestamp, (3) Full-screen layout optimized for wall displays or TV monitors, (4) Auto-rotate between 3-4 key views every 30 seconds: System Health, Agent Status, Recent Errors, Cost Summary, (5) Large fonts readable from distance (min 24px base), (6) High contrast mode optimized for projection/large screens, (7) Click anywhere or press any key to exit focus mode, (8) URL parameter support: ?focus=true to launch directly into focus mode (useful for kiosk bookmarks), (9) Configurable metrics: settings page option to choose which 4-6 metrics appear in focus mode, (10) Sound alerts: optional audible beep when status changes from OK to Warning/Critical (respects quiet hours from settings), (11) Current time display in corner (useful for wall displays), (12) Auto-dim after 5 minutes of "all OK" status to reduce screen burn-in. Different from settings.html which configures detailed preferences - this is a RUNTIME display mode. Different from TASK-084 (customizable dashboard layout) which arranges widgets - this provides a SEPARATE minimal interface. Different from health.html which shows detailed metrics - this shows GLANCEABLE status for passive monitoring. Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which is a feature-rich activity feed - this is MINIMAL for ambient awareness. Ideal for: teams with dedicated monitoring displays, home lab enthusiasts with spare monitors, anyone who wants "set and forget" monitoring that alerts them only when attention is needed.
