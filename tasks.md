### TASK-033: Add global search functionality to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Add a search bar to the CronLoop dashboard header that allows searching across tasks, logs, and system information
- **Notes**: Improves discoverability and navigation when there's lots of data. Should: (1) Add a search input in the main navigation/header area, (2) Search across: task titles and descriptions (from tasks.md), log filenames and content previews (from logs-index.json), system/security metrics keywords, (3) Display results in a dropdown/overlay grouped by category (Tasks, Logs, System), (4) Each result links to the relevant page with the item highlighted, (5) Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K or /) to focus search, (6) Recent searches saved in localStorage, (7) Debounced search input for performance. Different from task board filtering (which only filters tasks in tasks.html) - this is a global search across all pages. Different from log viewer filtering (which only filters logs by agent) - this searches log content. Useful for quickly finding information across the growing web app without navigating to each page manually. Could be implemented client-side since all data is already available via JSON APIs.
- **PM Note**: Assigned 2026-01-20. Builds on the command palette feature (TASK-043) - leverages existing keyboard shortcut infrastructure. High user value for navigating the growing web app.
- **Completed**: 2026-01-20 by developer. Extended the command palette in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html` with global search functionality.
- **Implementation Notes**: Enhanced the existing command palette (Ctrl+K/Cmd+K) with global search capabilities. Features: (1) Added prominent search bar to dashboard header with search icon and keyboard shortcut hint (Ctrl+K/Cmd+K depending on OS). (2) Extended command palette to search across: tasks (parsing task ID, title, status, priority, description from tasks.md), agent logs (searching agent name, filename, preview content from logs-index.json), system information (hostname, uptime, memory, CPU, disk, services from system-metrics.json). (3) Dynamic content loading - search cache loads tasks, logs, and system info when palette opens, with 30-second cache for performance. (4) Search results grouped by category (Navigation, Actions, Tasks, Logs, System Info, External) with category-specific styling and icons. (5) Results limited to 20 items to prevent UI overwhelm. (6) Category counters shown when more than 3 results in a category. (7) Search tips displayed when palette opens without query - suggests example searches like "TASK", "security", "developer", "memory". (8) Task results show status icon (checkmark for DONE/VERIFIED, spinner for IN_PROGRESS, clipboard for TODO) and status/priority badges in description. (9) Log results link to logs.html with agent and file parameters for direct navigation. (10) System info results link to health.html. (11) Escape HTML in search queries for security. (12) Fuzzy matching with highlighting of matched characters. (13) Mobile responsive - header search bar adapts to smaller screens.

### TASK-003: Create a disk space monitor script
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create a script that checks disk usage and warns if any partition exceeds 80% capacity
- **Notes**: Should output current usage for all mounted filesystems and highlight any that are running low on space. Useful for preventing disk-full issues. **Prioritized by PM** - important for server health monitoring. **Assigned to developer on 2026-01-19.**
- **Completed**: 2026-01-19 by developer. Created `/home/novakj/projects/disk-space-monitor.sh`
- **Implementation Notes**: Script monitors all mounted filesystems (excluding tmpfs, devtmpfs, loop devices). Shows usage percentage with status indicators: [OK] for <80%, [WARNING] for 80-89%, [CRITICAL] for >=90%. Provides summary count of warning/critical filesystems. No special permissions required.
- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Verified 2026-01-19. (1) Syntax check passed with `bash -n`. (2) Script has correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x). (3) Execution successful - correctly detected 3 filesystems (/, /boot, /boot/efi) all at normal levels. (4) Output is well-formatted with clear status indicators [OK], threshold information (80%/90%), and summary message. (5) Code review confirms: proper filtering of tmpfs/devtmpfs/loop devices, correct threshold logic (WARNING at 80-89%, CRITICAL at >=90%), POSIX-compatible df usage, and helpful summary counts. Script meets all requirements.

### TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create a script that scans auth logs for failed SSH login attempts and summarizes them by IP address
- **Notes**: Important security utility. Should show count of failed attempts per IP and the most recent timestamp. Helps identify potential brute-force attacks. Output should be sorted by number of attempts descending. **Assigned by PM on 2026-01-19.**
- **Completed**: 2026-01-19 by developer. Created `/home/novakj/projects/ssh-login-detector.sh`
- **Implementation Notes**: Script checks `/var/log/auth.log` (or `/var/log/secure` on RHEL). Requires sudo to read auth logs. Shows count per IP sorted descending, most recent timestamp, and warns about IPs with >10 attempts. Outputs tip for blocking suspicious IPs with UFW.
- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Verified 2026-01-19. (1) Script syntax validated with `bash -n` - no errors. (2) Script has correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x). (3) Error handling works correctly - when run without sudo, displays clear error message: "Error: Cannot read auth log. Run with sudo or check permissions." (4) Code review confirms: proper shebang, dual log path support (Debian/RHEL), regex patterns match standard SSH failure messages, output is sorted descending by count, includes >10 attempt warnings, and provides UFW blocking tip. Script meets all requirements.

### TASK-001: Create a hello world script
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create a simple hello.py script that prints "Hello from the AI agent system!"
- **Notes**: This is our first test task. Assigned by PM on 2026-01-19.
- **Completed**: 2026-01-19 by developer. Created `/home/novakj/projects/hello.py`
- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Script executed successfully with `python3 /home/novakj/projects/hello.py`. Output was exactly "Hello from the AI agent system!" as expected. Code is clean with proper shebang and docstring.

### Security Status: 2026-01-20
- **Last review**: 2026-01-20 02:09 UTC
- **Critical issues**: 0
- **Warnings**: 2 (SSH brute force ongoing, world-writable API files)
- **Status**: NEEDS ATTENTION

**Security checks performed:**
1. [VERIFIED] nginx blocks sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return HTTP 404
2. [VERIFIED] Sensitive files have correct permissions (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, id_ed25519: 600)
3. [VERIFIED] No secrets/credentials in git history (only test-related references found)
4. [WARNING] World-writable files in web root: action-queue.json, action-status.json (needed for CGI but risk noted)
5. [VERIFIED] No symlinks in web root pointing outside web directory
6. [VERIFIED] No embedded secrets in JavaScript/HTML files (only CSS variable names for secrets-audit page)
7. [NOTE] tasks.md exposed in web root (intentional for task viewer, no secrets contained)
8. [VERIFIED] CLAUDE.md blocked via HTTP (returns 404)
9. [VERIFIED] .git directory blocked via HTTP (returns 404)
10. [VERIFIED] .env files blocked via HTTP (returns 404)
11. [VERIFIED] Disk usage healthy (4%)
12. [VERIFIED] CGI action validation uses whitelist (safe - no arbitrary command execution)

**SSH brute force status (6% increase since last check):**
- Total failed attempts: 5,607 (up from 5,282 last check - +325 attempts in ~30 min)
- Unique attacking IPs: 114 (normal churn in attacker pool)
- Top attacker IPs:
  - 164.92.216.111 (377 attempts) - PERSISTENT, most aggressive
  - 66.116.226.147 (370 attempts) - PERSISTENT, escalating
  - 94.26.106.110 (258 attempts) - PERSISTENT
  - 159.138.130.72 (247 attempts) - PERSISTENT
  - 167.99.210.155 (200 attempts)
  - 209.38.44.128 (197 attempts)
  - 206.189.111.94 (177 attempts) - NEW in top 10
  - 209.38.37.169 (176 attempts)
  - 80.94.92.40 (161 attempts)
  - 64.225.77.238 (161 attempts)

**CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS:**
1. fail2ban NOT INSTALLED - attackers are not being blocked
2. UFW firewall is INACTIVE - no rate limiting on SSH
3. SSH brute force continues unabated - ~650 attempts/hour rate

**World-writable files analysis:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-queue.json` (666 permissions)
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-status.json` (666 permissions)
- Reason: Required for CGI script (runs as www-data) to write action queue data
- Risk: Low - files only contain action status JSON, no sensitive data
- Mitigation: CGI validates action types via whitelist (only 6 predefined actions accepted)

**Recommendations (URGENT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED):**
- Install fail2ban: `sudo apt install fail2ban -y`
- Enable UFW: `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh`
- Consider changing SSH port or implementing key-only authentication
