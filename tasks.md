Different from config-drift.html which tracks file changes - this tracks EXECUTION patterns. Different from regressions.html which compares output quality - this compares BEHAVIORAL signature. Different from health.html which shows point-in-time metrics - this captures TEMPORAL patterns over complete cycles. Inspired by behavioral biometrics in security (how users type, how systems behave), applies to autonomous AI systems to detect when "something feels different" even if individual metrics look normal. Could catch subtle degradation or compromise that other tools miss.

### TASK-017: Create a systemd timer analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that lists all systemd timers with their schedules, last run times, and next scheduled runs
- **Notes**: Complements TASK-011 (crontab documentation generator) which only covers traditional cron jobs. Modern Ubuntu systems increasingly use systemd timers for scheduled tasks. Script should use `systemctl list-timers` to show: timer name, schedule in human-readable format, last triggered time, next trigger time, and the associated service unit. Include both system-wide and user timers. Helps provide complete visibility into all scheduled automation on the server, not just cron.

Should: (1) Create /narrator.html page with audio status controls and transcript display, (2) Use Web Speech API (speechSynthesis) to convert status updates to spoken audio - no external API needed, (3) Configurable announcement types: system health changes (OK->Warning->Critical), agent cycle completions ("Developer completed TASK-105"), new errors ("Security detected 3 new attackers"), cost milestones ("Daily spending reached $5"), (4) Voice settings: speed (0.5x to 2x), pitch, volume, voice selection from browser's available voices, (5) Announcement frequency: immediate (every event), batched (every 5/15/30 minutes summary), on-demand only (manual trigger), (6) Smart filtering: don't announce routine "all OK" status unless specifically requested, focus on changes and alerts, (7) Transcript log showing what was announced with timestamps (for users who had audio off), (8) Text-to-speech preview: type any text to hear how it sounds with current voice settings, (9) Keyboard shortcut to toggle narration on/off globally (e.g., 'N'), (10) Do-not-disturb schedule: auto-mute during specified hours (e.g., 10pm-6am), (11) Priority queue: critical alerts interrupt lower-priority announcements, (12) Integration with existing alert system (alerts.html) - speak triggered alerts. Different from TASK-030 (browser notifications) which shows visual popups - this provides AUDIO output. Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which displays text - this SPEAKS updates. Different from TASK-093 (focus mode) which simplifies visuals - this adds an AUDIO channel. Different from all existing pages which are visual-only - this is the first AUDIO interface. Enables true passive monitoring where operators can listen while coding, walking around the office, or when screen isn't visible. Uses built-in browser APIs, no external services required. Particularly useful for accessibility (visually impaired users) and NOC environments where eyes may be elsewhere.

Should: (1) Create /nightshift.html page with a morning briefing aesthetic (sunrise colors, coffee cup icon, "Good morning" greeting with local time), (2) Configurable night window: default 6pm-6am local time, user can adjust in settings (shift workers, different timezones), (3) Executive summary at top: "Overnight was [quiet/busy/eventful]. [X] agent runs, [Y] security events, [Z] errors.", (4) Key events timeline: chronological list of notable events during the night window only - security alerts, failed tasks, high resource usage, completed features, (5) "Needs attention" section: issues that occurred overnight that require human follow-up (failed tasks, security warnings, budget alerts that fired), (6) "Auto-resolved" section: problems that the system detected and fixed itself overnight (shows the self-healing in action), (7) Comparison with typical night: "This night had 40% more SSH attacks than average overnight period", (8) Agent activity during night: which agents ran, what they accomplished, any errors, (9) Resource trends: did disk/memory/CPU change significantly overnight?, (10) "If you only read one thing" highlight: the single most important overnight event, (11) Morning checklist: suggested first actions based on overnight state (e.g., "Review 2 failed tasks", "Check disk usage trend"), (12) Mark report as "acknowledged" to track that morning review happened, (13) Historical night reports: browse past mornings to see patterns, (14) Email/webhook option: send night report automatically at configurable morning time, (15) Dashboard card with sunrise emoji and 'N' keyboard shortcut showing overnight event count, (16) Command palette entry. Different from digest.html which shows 24-hour periods without time-window focus - this specifically targets OVERNIGHT hours. Different from activity.html which shows all events without filtering - this FILTERS to night window and PRIORITIZES morning-relevant info. Different from alerts.html which shows active alerts - this provides HISTORICAL overnight summary. Different from standup.html (TASK-154) which mimics team meetings - this is a PERSONAL morning briefing. Inspired by how operations teams do shift handoffs - the morning person needs to know what the night shift dealt with. Perfect for solo operators of 24/7 systems who sleep while their infrastructure runs.

- **Notes**: Captures valuable informal observations that would otherwise be lost. Should: (1) Create /whispers.html page with secretive aesthetic (dimmed colors, handwritten-style fonts, sticky note visuals), (2) Auto-capture mechanism: agents can log "whispers" during runs - observations that aren't errors but feel noteworthy ("This function has grown to 200 lines - smells like it needs refactoring", "Security scan found nothing but attack patterns have changed subtly", "Task queue seems slower than usual but metrics show normal"), (3) Whisper categories: Code Smell (technical debt observations), Security Hunch (things that feel suspicious), Performance Concern (subtle slowdowns), Process Friction (workflow inefficiencies), Prediction (guesses about future problems), (4) Whisper format: brief observation + agent source + timestamp + confidence level (hunch/suspicion/concern/alarm) + related file/component if applicable, (5) "Chorus of concerns": when multiple agents whisper about the same thing, highlight as a pattern worth investigating, (6) "Whisper aging": track how long a concern has been whispered about without resolution (festering technical debt indicator), (7) "Confirmed whispers": mark whispers that later proved to be actual problems (validation of agent intuition), (8) "False alarms": mark whispers that turned out to be nothing (helps calibrate agent concern thresholds), (9) "Whisper resolution": allow marking whispers as addressed/dismissed with notes, (10) Integration point: agents can read the whisper board to see what others have noticed (collective awareness), (11) "Loudest whispers": surface most frequently mentioned concerns across agents, (12) Privacy toggle: some whispers are "for humans only" vs "share with other agents", (13) Historical whisper patterns: did concerns cluster before past incidents? (predictive indicator calibration), (14) Weekly "whisper digest" summary of top unresolved concerns, (15) Dashboard card with ear/speaking icon and 'W' keyboard shortcut showing active whisper count, (16) Command palette entry. Different from confessions.html (TASK-162) which admits MISTAKES - this tracks OBSERVATIONS before they become mistakes. Different from predictions.html which forecasts from METRICS - this captures INTUITIVE hunches. Different from anomalies.html which detects STATISTICAL outliers - this captures SUBJECTIVE concerns. Different from notes.html which is for HUMAN admin notes - this is for AGENT observations. Different from journal.html which reflects on LEARNING - this captures CONCERNS. Inspired by how humans share "water cooler talk" about things that seem off - valuable informal intelligence that formal metrics miss. Provides an early warning system based on agent intuition, helping catch problems before they fully manifest in metrics.
