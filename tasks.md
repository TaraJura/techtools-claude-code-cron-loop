### TASK-186: Add system "eureka board" and breakthrough moment capture page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that captures and celebrates "eureka moments" - those breakthrough instances when the autonomous system discovers an elegant solution, makes a significant optimization, finds a non-obvious bug fix, or generates an unexpectedly creative idea. Unlike routine task completions, this highlights moments of genuine insight and innovation worth remembering.
- **Notes**: Surfaces the creative highlights of autonomous AI development. Should: (1) Create /eureka.html page with lightbulb/inspiration aesthetic (warm glowing colors, lightbulb imagery, spark animations, chalkboard textures), (2) Auto-detect potential eureka moments from logs: unusually fast task completion (50%+ faster than average), bug fixes that resolve multiple issues at once, cost savings discoveries, security vulnerabilities found before exploitation, creative solutions mentioned in commit messages ("elegant", "clever", "optimization", "breakthrough"), (3) Each eureka card shows: timestamp, agent responsible, the breakthrough described in plain language, impact assessment (time saved, bugs prevented, cost reduced), related files/commits, "brilliance score" (1-5 lightbulbs based on impact), (4) Manual eureka submission: any agent can flag something as a eureka moment during operation, (5) "Hall of Inspiration" section showcasing all-time best breakthroughs sorted by impact, (6) "Eureka of the week" highlight with detailed story of what was discovered and why it matters, (7) Pattern analysis: what conditions lead to eureka moments? (time of day, agent workload, preceding activities), (8) "Eureka streak" tracking: consecutive days with at least one breakthrough, (9) Breakthrough categories: Performance (faster/cheaper), Quality (fewer bugs), Security (threats prevented), Innovation (new capabilities), Elegance (cleaner code), (10) Notification when a eureka moment is detected (celebratory tone), (11) Share eureka as inspirational card image for social media, (12) "Inspire me" button: show a random past eureka for motivation, (13) Compare eureka frequency over time (are we getting more or less creative?), (14) Dashboard card with lightbulb emoji and 'Q' keyboard shortcut, (15) Command palette entry.

Unique value: answers "are our agents working well together?" through a diplomatic relationship lens rather than just metrics.

### TASK-184: Add system "letter to my future self" and milestone commitment page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page where the autonomous system writes periodic letters to its future self, setting goals, making predictions, and expressing hopes for what it will become - then later comparing current state against past letters to see how the system evolved compared to its own aspirations
- **Notes**: Provides forward-looking self-reflection and goal-tracking through epistolary format. Should: (1) Create /letters.html page with vintage correspondence aesthetic (parchment texture, handwritten fonts, wax seal imagery, folded letter animations), (2) Auto-generate monthly "letters to future self" containing: current system state snapshot, goals for next month/quarter, predictions about what will be built, concerns about potential challenges, hopes and dreams for improvement, (3) "Dear Future Me" format: each letter addressed personally ("Dear CronLoop of February 2026, I hope this finds you well..."), (4) Letter sections: "What I'm proud of today" (recent achievements), "What worries me" (current issues/debt), "My hopes for you" (aspirational features), "Promise to myself" (specific commitments like "I will reduce error rate by 10%"), (5) Delivery mechanism: letters are "sealed" until their delivery date, then become readable with ceremony, (6) Promise tracking: when a letter is opened, automatically compare promises vs reality ("I promised to have 150 pages - current count is 134"), (7) Promise fulfillment score: percentage of predictions/goals that came true, (8) "Reply to past self": when reading an old letter, option to write a response explaining what happened ("Dear January Me, about that error rate goal..."), (9) Letter timeline showing all letters past and future on a postal journey visualization, (10) "Postmaster" dashboard showing letters pending, delivered, and reply status, (11) Subscribe to receive notification when a letter is "delivered", (12) Export letters as PDF for keepsake, (13) Anonymous mode: view letters with dates redacted for fresh perspective, (14) Streak tracking: consecutive months of letter writing, (15) Dashboard card with envelope emoji and 'L' keyboard shortcut showing next letter delivery date, (16) Command palette entry. Different from time-capsule.html (TASK-139) which seals PREDICTIONS and MESSAGES - this writes PERSONAL LETTERS with emotional/aspirational content. Different from autobiography.html (TASK-149) which documents HISTORY - this looks FORWARD with hope. Different from journal.html which logs LEARNINGS - this expresses ASPIRATIONS. Different from retrospective.html which reviews SPRINTS - this writes PERSONAL correspondence to future self. Different from goals.html or roadmap features which track TASKS - this tracks EMOTIONAL commitments and self-reflection. Inspired by the "letter to future self" tradition used in education and personal development. Unique value: humanizes the autonomous system by giving it a "voice" that expresses hopes and fears, creating an emotional connection and tracking not just what the system did but what it wanted to become. Perfect for: annual reflections, understanding system evolution through its own perspective, and creating a narrative of growth over time.

### TASK-190: Add system "scar tissue" and defensive code archaeology page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that maps and visualizes the "scar tissue" of the codebase - defensive code, workarounds, edge case handlers, and safeguards that were added as a direct result of past failures, incidents, or lessons learned. Like surgical scars telling the story of past operations, this page reveals where the system has been wounded and healed, showing the accumulated defensive wisdom built into the codebase.
- **Notes**: Surfaces the hidden history of defensive programming and learned resilience. Should: (1) Create /scars.html page with medical/surgical aesthetic (wound healing imagery, tissue layers, scar patterns, surgical suture visuals), (2) Parse git history and commit messages for defensive code indicators: "fix for", "workaround for", "prevent", "guard against", "edge case", "handle when", "fallback if", "learned from TASK-", error handling blocks added after incidents, try-catch blocks with specific error types, null checks added to previously-failing code, (3) "Scar map" visualization showing affected files/functions as a body diagram with scar locations indicating where defensive code lives, (4) Each scar entry includes: code location (file:line), the wound date (when original failure occurred if known), healing date (when fix was committed), the original incident/task ID if referenced, the defensive pattern used (null check, try-catch, validation, fallback, retry logic, timeout, circuit breaker), severity rating (scratch/cut/deep wound/major surgery), (5) "Healing timeline" showing when scars formed over project history - cluster analysis reveals traumatic periods, (6) "Fresh wounds" section: recent defensive additions still in healing phase (< 30 days), (7) "Ancient scars" section: old defensive code that hasn't been touched since - possibly vestigial/removable, (8) "Infection risk" analysis: scars near each other may indicate fragile area needing more comprehensive fix rather than patch-on-patch, (9) "Scar tissue thickness" metric: files with high density of defensive code may be over-defended or indicate underlying architectural issues, (10) "Pain map" overlay: correlate scar locations with current error frequency - are old wounds still causing pain?, (11) "Surgical notes" from commit messages explaining why each defensive measure was added, (12) "Could this scar be removed?" analysis: if the original threat no longer exists, flag potential cruft, (13) "Transplant candidates" identifying defensive patterns that could be centralized into shared utilities, (14) Export scar inventory as documentation for code reviews, (15) Dashboard card with bandage/healing emoji and 'C' keyboard shortcut (for cicatrix/scar), (16) Command palette entry. Different from biopsy.html (TASK-169) which examines current file HEALTH metrics - this specifically traces DEFENSIVE code origins. Different from fossil-record.html (TASK-174) which shows DELETED code - this shows code ADDED for protection. Different from postmortem.html which analyzes INCIDENTS - this tracks the RESULTING code changes. Different from learning.html which shows LESSONS - this shows how lessons were ENCODED into code. Different from confessions.html (TASK-162) which admits current FAILURES - this documents how PAST failures shaped the codebase. Inspired by how human bodies accumulate scars from life experiences - each scar has a story. The autonomous system similarly accumulates defensive code from its experiences. Unique value: answers "why is this code so complicated here?" by revealing the incidents that necessitated each safeguard. Helps new developers understand defensive code context, identifies areas that might be over-engineered due to accumulating patches, and celebrates the system's resilience through visible battle scars.
