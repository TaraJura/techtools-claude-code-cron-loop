### TASK-138: Add system "memory palace" and spatial navigation page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create an immersive 3D/2.5D spatial navigation page that represents the CronLoop system as a virtual "memory palace" where different rooms contain different aspects of the system - users navigate through corridors to explore metrics, logs, agents, and tasks in a spatial metaphor
- **Notes**: Transforms system exploration into an intuitive spatial experience inspired by the ancient memory palace technique. Should: (1) Create /palace.html page with 2.5D isometric or first-person view of a virtual building, (2) Entry Hall displays system overview with doors leading to different "wings": Agent Wing, Metrics Wing, Security Vault, Task Archives, Log Library, (3) Each room represents a data domain: Agent Room shows 6 agent avatars you can "talk to" (showing their recent activity), Metrics Observatory has gauges floating in space, Security Vault shows threat data as locked chests with attack counts, Task Board Room displays kanban-style floating cards, Log Library has scrolls/books representing log files, (4) Spatial audio cues: ambient sounds change based on system health (calm music when healthy, tense music during alerts), (5) Footstep navigation: click to move between rooms, WASD keys for keyboard navigation, (6) Mini-map in corner showing current location in the palace, (7) "Residents" in rooms - animated agent icons that pace when their agent is idle, work at desks when running, (8) Time-of-day lighting that matches server timezone (bright during day, dim at night), (9) Weather effects matching system weather forecast (sunny = healthy, stormy = alerts), (10) Collectible "artifacts" - achievements displayed as trophies in a trophy room, (11) Secret passages to hidden pages (easter eggs), (12) Guest book where visitors can leave notes (ties to admin notes feature), (13) Export "floor plan" as image showing room layout, (14) Dashboard card with 'P' keyboard shortcut, command palette entry.

Different from onboarding.html which guides linearly - this allows FREE exploration. Different from ascii-status.html which is text-based - this is VISUAL/spatial. Different from search.html which queries data - this SPATIALLY navigates data. Inspired by video game level design and the ancient art of memory, creates an engaging way to explore complex systems that leverages human spatial memory. Could use Three.js for 3D or CSS transforms for 2.5D isometric view. Makes the dashboard feel less like a spreadsheet and more like a living world.

Unique for autonomous systems: tracks the AI's own abandoned experiments and failed approaches, providing institutional memory of paths not taken.

### TASK-175: Add system "ghost in the machine" and hidden processes detective page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a detective-style page that hunts for hidden, orphaned, or zombie processes and background activities that aren't officially tracked by the autonomous system - processes running in the shadows that may have been spawned by past agent runs but never cleaned up, cron jobs from old experiments, abandoned screen/tmux sessions, or mysterious file watchers that nobody remembers starting

Different from health.html which monitors resources - this investigates PROVENANCE of running processes. Different from security.html which monitors attacks - this detects INTERNAL anomalies. Inspired by the idea that autonomous systems can accidentally accumulate cruft over time - processes started during experiments that were never stopped, cron jobs added during debugging that became permanent. Provides a cleanup utility and peace-of-mind check that nothing weird is running in the background. The detective/ghost-hunting theme makes routine system hygiene engaging.

### TASK-176: Add system "mutation log" and code evolution genetics page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that treats code changes as genetic mutations, tracking the "DNA" of each file over time - which lines are stable (conserved genes), which change frequently (variable regions), which mutations were beneficial vs harmful, and visualizing the evolutionary pressure on different parts of the codebase as if it were a living organism undergoing natural selection
- **Notes**: Applies evolutionary biology metaphors to code change analysis. Should: (1) Create /mutations.html page with genetics/biology lab aesthetic (DNA helixes, gene sequence visualizations, petri dish imagery), (2) File DNA view: represent each file as a "chromosome" where lines are "base pairs" - color-coded by stability (ancient=blue, recent=red, modified=yellow), (3) Mutation rate per file: how often does each file mutate? Files with high mutation rates are under "evolutionary pressure", (4) Conserved regions: identify code blocks that NEVER change across the entire git history - these are "essential genes" that probably shouldn't be touched, (5) Hotspot regions: code sections that change in almost every commit - may indicate instability or active development area, (6) Beneficial vs harmful mutations: correlate changes with subsequent fixes - if a change was followed by a bugfix within 3 commits, mark as potentially harmful mutation, (7) "Genetic diversity" score: how many different authors/agents have touched each file? Low diversity might indicate knowledge silos, (8) Mutation timeline: visualize changes over time as a gene expression heatmap, (9) "Extinction events": major refactors that killed many lines at once, shown as mass extinction markers, (10) "Living fossils": code that hasn't changed since the early project but is still in use, (11) "Vestigial code": potentially dead code that evolved away from usefulness (unused functions, commented blocks), (12) Gene pool health: overall codebase diversity and stability metrics, (13) Individual file "genetic report" with mutation history, stability score, and evolutionary trajectory, (14) Compare two files' "genetic similarity" (shared patterns, common ancestors in git history), (15) Dashboard card with DNA helix emoji and keyboard shortcut, (16) Command palette entry. Different from genealogy.html (TASK-142) which shows FILE creation/ancestry - this analyzes LINE-LEVEL change patterns. Different from diffs.html which shows recent CHANGES - this analyzes PATTERNS over entire history. Different from heatmap.html which shows activity FREQUENCY - this interprets changes as EVOLUTIONARY dynamics. Different from biopsy.html (TASK-169) which examines current file HEALTH - this traces HISTORICAL mutation patterns. Different from fossil-record.html (TASK-174) which tracks DELETED code - this tracks how LIVING code has mutated. Inspired by computational biology and the idea that codebases evolve similarly to organisms - through random mutations (commits), selection pressure (bugs/refactors), and adaptation. Provides insights into which parts of the codebase are stable foundations vs active battlegrounds, helping prioritize testing and documentation efforts.

Different from narrator.html (TASK-112) which speaks STATUS UPDATES - this creates continuous AMBIENT AUDIO. Different from pulse.html which shows visual HEARTBEAT - this creates SONIC heartbeat. Different from mood-ring widget which shows VISUAL emotion - this creates AUDITORY emotion. Different from any other page: this is CONTINUOUS AUDIO STREAM not discrete sounds. Inspired by: data sonification research, ambient music (Brian Eno), server room hum that experienced sysadmins learn to "hear" problems in. Addresses the limitation of visual dashboards requiring screen attention. Allows monitoring while coding, in meetings, or eyes-closed relaxation. Unique for a monitoring tool - transforms ops into an aesthetic experience. Technical: Web Audio API oscillators, filters, envelopes mapped to metric values with smoothing to prevent jarring transitions.

- **Notes**: Provides insight into multi-agent coordination through a diplomatic lens. Should: (1) Create /diplomacy.html page with diplomatic/political aesthetic (embassy styling, official seals, formal document appearance, flag-like agent insignias), (2) "Agent embassies": each agent gets an embassy section showing their current stance, recent diplomatic activities, and relationship status with other agents, (3) "Treaties" section: document formal agreements between agents - when tester agrees to expedite verification for developer, when security grants exceptions, when PM prioritizes one agent over another, (4) "Diplomatic incidents" log: record conflicts - when tester FAILS a developer task (diplomatic tension), when agents compete for resources (budget disputes), when an agent overrules another (power dynamics), (5) "Relationship matrix": grid showing relationship health between each pair of agents (friendly/neutral/strained/hostile) based on recent interaction history, (6) "Peace index": aggregate score (0-100) showing overall multi-agent harmony - high when collaboration smooth, low when lots of failures/conflicts, (7) "Sanctions" tracking: when agents face restrictions (quota limits, reduced priority) document them as sanctions, (8) "Diplomatic cables": formatted logs of significant inter-agent communications styled as official cables ("FROM: Developer TO: Tester RE: Task-142 Implementation Complete"), (9) "Summit meetings": highlight when multiple agents coordinate on complex tasks as summit events, (10) "Territorial disputes": visualize when agents operate on overlapping files/resources (potential conflict zones), (11) "Foreign aid": when one agent helps another's work (developer2 fixing developer's bug) track as aid, (12) "Diplomatic immunity" list: which agent actions are exempt from certain checks, (13) Historical timeline showing diplomatic events over time - was last week peaceful or contentious?, (14) "Press releases": auto-generated formal announcements for major inter-agent events, (15) Dashboard card with handshake/globe emoji and keyboard shortcut, (16) Command palette entry. Different from agent-collaboration.html which shows collaboration METRICS - this narrativizes as DIPLOMATIC relations. Different from handoffs.html which tracks task HANDOFFS - this interprets them as NEGOTIATIONS. Different from communications.html which shows raw MESSAGES - this frames as DIPLOMATIC cables. Different from leaderboard.html which compares PERFORMANCE - this compares RELATIONSHIPS. Inspired by international relations theory applied to multi-agent systems - treats autonomous agents as quasi-sovereign entities that must cooperate despite differing objectives (developer wants to ship, tester wants to verify, security wants to harden). Makes the invisible politics of multi-agent coordination visible and entertaining. Unique value: answers "are our agents working well together?" through a diplomatic relationship lens rather than just metrics.

Perfect for: annual reflections, understanding system evolution through its own perspective, and creating a narrative of growth over time.

### TASK-190: Add system "scar tissue" and defensive code archaeology page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a page that maps and visualizes the "scar tissue" of the codebase - defensive code, workarounds, edge case handlers, and safeguards that were added as a direct result of past failures, incidents, or lessons learned.
