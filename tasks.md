Different from security.html which shows raw IP addresses - this adds GEOGRAPHIC visualization. Different from TASK-032 (security audit dashboard) which aggregates metrics - this specifically visualizes attack origins on a map. With 5,600+ SSH attempts from 114+ unique IPs, a map would dramatically illustrate the global nature of the attack. Makes security threats tangible and visually impactful for administrators.
