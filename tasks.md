- **Description**: Create a focus mode that presents a minimal, distraction-free view of key metrics for wall-mounted displays, kiosk mode, or users who want simplified monitoring without dashboard clutter
- **Notes**: Provides streamlined monitoring experience for NOC displays or dedicated monitoring screens. Should: (1) Add "Focus Mode" toggle button to main dashboard header (keyboard shortcut 'F'), (2) Focus mode hides navigation, command palette, cards grid, and shows only: large system health indicator (OK/Warning/Critical), current CPU/Memory/Disk as large circular gauges, agent pipeline status (5 dots showing last run status), error count badge if >0, last activity timestamp, (3) Full-screen layout optimized for wall displays or TV monitors, (4) Auto-rotate between 3-4 key views every 30 seconds: System Health, Agent Status, Recent Errors, Cost Summary, (5) Large fonts readable from distance (min 24px base), (6) High contrast mode optimized for projection/large screens, (7) Click anywhere or press any key to exit focus mode, (8) URL parameter support: ?focus=true to launch directly into focus mode (useful for kiosk bookmarks), (9) Configurable metrics: settings page option to choose which 4-6 metrics appear in focus mode, (10) Sound alerts: optional audible beep when status changes from OK to Warning/Critical (respects quiet hours from settings), (11) Current time display in corner (useful for wall displays), (12) Auto-dim after 5 minutes of "all OK" status to reduce screen burn-in. Different from settings.html which configures detailed preferences - this is a RUNTIME display mode. Different from TASK-084 (customizable dashboard layout) which arranges widgets - this provides a SEPARATE minimal interface. Different from health.html which shows detailed metrics - this shows GLANCEABLE status for passive monitoring. Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which is a feature-rich activity feed - this is MINIMAL for ambient awareness. Ideal for: teams with dedicated monitoring displays, home lab enthusiasts with spare monitors, anyone who wants "set and forget" monitoring that alerts them only when attention is needed.

### TASK-095: Add agent collaboration chat log page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a page that reconstructs the "conversation" between agents by showing how one agent's output becomes another agent's input, visualizing the implicit dialogue in the multi-agent pipeline
- **Notes**: Provides visibility into inter-agent communication that currently happens through shared files (tasks.md). Should: (1) Create /collaboration.html page showing agent-to-agent communication timeline, (2) Parse agent logs and git history to reconstruct the sequence: idea-maker adds task → PM assigns → developer implements → tester reviews, (3) Display as a chat-like interface where each agent appears as a "participant" with their contributions as messages, (4) Show what each agent "said" to the next: idea description, assignment notes, implementation commits, test feedback, (5) Color-code by agent with avatars/icons (idea-maker=lightbulb, PM=clipboard, developer=code, tester=checkmark, security=shield), (6) Track a specific task's journey from creation to completion as a thread, (7) Show "quoted" context - what the developer saw when picking up a task from PM, (8) Highlight miscommunications: when tester feedback indicates developer misunderstood requirements, (9) Filter by task ID to follow single task thread, or by date range for all activity, (10) Statistics panel: average messages per task, most active collaboration pairs, communication bottlenecks, (11) "Reply chain" visualization showing back-and-forth (task returned for fixes multiple times), (12) Export conversation thread as markdown for documentation. Different from TASK-062 (handoff inspector) which shows DATA FLOW metrics - this shows the actual CONTENT of communications in a readable chat format. Different from TASK-072 (communication timeline) which shows tool OPERATIONS - this shows agent-to-agent MESSAGES reconstructed from shared artifacts. Different from TASK-038 (conversation viewer) which shows Claude's internal reasoning - this shows inter-agent dialogue. Helps understand how agents "talk" to each other and where communication breaks down.
