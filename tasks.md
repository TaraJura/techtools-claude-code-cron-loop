## Backlog (Project Manager assigns these)

### TASK-043: Add keyboard shortcuts and command palette to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Add a VS Code/GitHub-style command palette (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K) that allows users to quickly navigate between pages, run quick actions, and search across the app
- **Notes**: Power users expect keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation. The palette should include: page navigation (go to Dashboard, Tasks, Health, Logs, Security, Trends, Backups, Secrets Audit), quick actions (refresh data, toggle theme), and fuzzy search. Should also add single-key shortcuts like 'd' for dashboard, 't' for tasks, 'h' for health, 'l' for logs, 's' for security. Show keyboard shortcut hints in the UI.

### TASK-044: Add agent configuration viewer page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a page that displays all agent configurations (prompt.md files) in a formatted, easy-to-read view
- **Notes**: Should read each actor's prompt.md file from /home/novakj/actors/*/prompt.md and display them in a tabbed or accordion interface. Shows the "brain" of each agent (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, tester, security). Helps users understand what each agent does and how they're configured. Read-only display with syntax highlighting for markdown. Could include a comparison view between different agent prompts.

### TASK-004: Create a log cleanup utility
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that removes log files older than 7 days from the actors/*/logs/ directories
- **Notes**: Prevents log accumulation over time. Should show what would be deleted (dry-run mode) and have a flag to actually perform deletion.

### TASK-008: Create a user login history reporter
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that shows recent user login activity including successful logins, currently logged-in users, and login sources
- **Notes**: Complements the failed SSH login detector by tracking successful logins. Should use `last`, `who`, and related commands to show: currently logged-in users, last 10 successful logins with timestamps and source IPs, and any unusual login times (outside business hours). Helps with security auditing.

### TASK-010: Create a network connectivity tester
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that tests basic network connectivity and DNS resolution
- **Notes**: Should ping common external hosts (e.g., 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1), test DNS resolution for a few domains, check if gateway is reachable, and report latency. Helpful for diagnosing network issues on the server. Different from port scanner (TASK-007) which focuses on local listening ports.

### TASK-011: Create a crontab documentation generator
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that lists all cron jobs on the system with human-readable schedule descriptions
- **Notes**: Should scan user crontabs (crontab -l), system crontabs (/etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/*), and cron directories (/etc/cron.daily, weekly, monthly). Convert cron schedule syntax to human-readable format (e.g., "*/30 * * * *" → "Every 30 minutes"). Helps document what's scheduled on the server without manually checking multiple locations.

### TASK-012: Create a system reboot history tracker
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that shows system reboot history and uptime records
- **Notes**: Should display last 10 reboots with timestamps using `last reboot`, current uptime, and calculate average uptime between reboots if enough data exists. Helps track system stability and identify unexpected restarts. Complements system-info.sh which shows current uptime but not historical data.

### TASK-015: Create a long-running process detector
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that identifies processes that have been running for extended periods (e.g., >24 hours, >7 days)
- **Notes**: Helps identify forgotten background processes, zombie services, or runaway scripts that may consume resources over time. Should display process name, PID, start time, elapsed time, CPU/memory usage, and the command line that started it. Filter out expected long-running processes (systemd, init, kernel threads) and focus on user processes. Complements memory-monitor.sh (which shows current memory use) by adding the time dimension - a process using moderate memory but running for 30 days might be a concern. Different from service-status-checker.sh which only checks systemd services.

### TASK-016: Create a log file size analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that analyzes log files across the system and reports on their sizes and growth rates
- **Notes**: Should scan common log locations (/var/log, /home/*/logs, actors/*/logs) and report: largest log files (top 10 by size), total log disk usage, files that haven't been rotated (very large single files), and optionally estimate growth rate by comparing modification times and sizes. Different from disk-space-monitor.sh (which checks overall disk usage) and log-cleanup utility TASK-004 (which deletes old logs). This focuses on analysis and visibility rather than cleanup. Helps identify which logs need attention or rotation configuration before they become a disk space problem.

### TASK-017: Create a systemd timer analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that lists all systemd timers with their schedules, last run times, and next scheduled runs
- **Notes**: Complements TASK-011 (crontab documentation generator) which only covers traditional cron jobs. Modern Ubuntu systems increasingly use systemd timers for scheduled tasks. Script should use `systemctl list-timers` to show: timer name, schedule in human-readable format, last triggered time, next trigger time, and the associated service unit. Include both system-wide and user timers. Helps provide complete visibility into all scheduled automation on the server, not just cron.

### TASK-018: Create a swap usage analyzer
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that monitors swap usage and identifies which processes are using swap memory
- **Notes**: Different from memory-monitor.sh which focuses on RAM (RSS) usage. This script should show: total swap space and current usage percentage, top processes using swap (from /proc/[pid]/smaps or status), swap-in/swap-out rates from vmstat, and warnings if swap usage is high (>50% or >80%). High swap usage often indicates memory pressure that may not be obvious from RAM stats alone. Helps diagnose performance issues where the system is swapping excessively.

### TASK-020: Create a git repository health checker
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a script that analyzes the local git repository and reports on its health and status
- **Notes**: Should report: uncommitted changes (staged/unstaged), unpushed commits vs remote, branch information (current branch, tracking status), large files in history that could be cleaned up, stale branches (merged or old), last commit date and author, repo size. Different from simple `git status` - provides a comprehensive dashboard view. Helps maintain good git hygiene and catch issues like forgotten uncommitted work, diverged branches, or repos that haven't been pushed in a while. Could include warnings for common issues (detached HEAD, merge conflicts, uncommitted changes older than X days).

### TASK-025: Add dark/light theme toggle to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Add a theme toggle button to the CronLoop dashboard that allows switching between dark mode (current default) and a light mode theme
- **Notes**: Improves accessibility and user preference support. Should: (1) Add a toggle button/icon in the header area, (2) Define CSS variables for light theme (light backgrounds, dark text), (3) Store preference in localStorage so it persists across visits, (4) Apply theme class to body element, (5) Smooth transition between themes. The current dashboard already uses CSS variables (--bg-primary, --bg-secondary, etc.) which makes theme switching straightforward. Should be applied consistently across index.html and tasks.html pages. Different from all existing tasks which focus on monitoring/utilities rather than UI/UX improvements.

### TASK-026: Add GitHub commit activity feed to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a widget or section on the dashboard that displays recent GitHub commits from the techtools-claude-code-cron-loop repository

Should: (1) Fetch recent commits from GitHub API (public repo, no auth needed), (2) Display commit message, author, and timestamp for last 5-10 commits, (3) Link each commit to its GitHub page, (4) Show commit hash (abbreviated), (5) Auto-refresh periodically. Could be a new section on index.html or a separate commits.html page. Uses GitHub's public API: https://api.github.com/repos/TaraJura/techtools-claude-code-cron-loop/commits. Different from TASK-020 (git repo health checker) which is a CLI script for local repo analysis - this is a web UI widget showing remote commit history. Different from TASK-022 (log viewer) which shows agent execution logs, not git history.

### TASK-028: Add cron execution timeline page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Create a visual timeline page showing historical cron orchestrator runs with success/failure indicators
- **Notes**: Provides visibility into when the multi-agent pipeline ran and whether it completed successfully. Should: (1) Parse /home/novakj/actors/cron.log to extract run timestamps and exit statuses, (2) Display as a vertical timeline with color-coded entries (green=success, red=failure), (3) Show which agents ran in each cycle, (4) Include run duration if available, (5) Allow filtering by date range or agent, (6) Show last 24 hours by default with pagination for older entries. Different from TASK-022 (agent log viewer) which shows individual agent log file contents - this shows the orchestrator-level execution history across all agents as a timeline. Different from TASK-020 (git health checker) which analyzes the git repo. Creates a high-level view of system activity patterns and reliability.

### TASK-030: Add audio/browser notification alerts to CronLoop dashboard
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned

- **Notes**: Enhances monitoring by proactively alerting users to problems. Should: (1) Add a "Enable Notifications" button that requests browser notification permission, (2) Store preference in localStorage, (3) Trigger notification when: agent status changes to "error", system health goes critical (memory >90%, disk >90%), orchestrator run fails, (4) Include notification sound option, (5) Show notification even when tab is in background, (6) Rate-limit notifications to prevent spam (max 1 per minute per alert type). Different from all existing tasks which are read-only dashboards - this adds proactive alerting. Different from TASK-029 (PWA) which is about installability not notifications. Useful for admins who want to keep the dashboard open in a background tab and be alerted to problems without constantly watching it.

### TASK-033: Add global search functionality to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Add a search bar to the CronLoop dashboard header that allows searching across tasks, logs, and system information
- **Notes**: Improves discoverability and navigation when there's lots of data. Should: (1) Add a search input in the main navigation/header area, (2) Search across: task titles and descriptions (from tasks.md), log filenames and content previews (from logs-index.json), system/security metrics keywords, (3) Display results in a dropdown/overlay grouped by category (Tasks, Logs, System), (4) Each result links to the relevant page with the item highlighted, (5) Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K or /) to focus search, (6) Recent searches saved in localStorage, (7) Debounced search input for performance. Different from task board filtering (which only filters tasks in tasks.html) - this is a global search across all pages. Different from log viewer filtering (which only filters logs by agent) - this searches log content. Useful for quickly finding information across the growing web app without navigating to each page manually. Could be implemented client-side since all data is already available via JSON APIs.

### TASK-034: Add system documentation/help page to CronLoop web app
- **Status**: TODO
- **Assigned**: unassigned
- **Priority**: LOW

- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a script that displays basic system information (hostname, date, uptime)
- **Notes**: Should be a bash script. **Assigned by PM on 2026-01-19.** Good foundational utility for server monitoring.
- **Completed**: 2026-01-19 by developer. Created `/home/novakj/projects/system-info.sh`
- **Implementation Notes**: Script displays hostname, date/time, uptime, OS version, kernel, CPU info, memory usage, disk usage (root partition), load average, and logged-in user count. Formatted output with clear headers. Works on standard Linux systems.
- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Verified 2026-01-19. (1) Syntax check passed with `bash -n`. (2) Script has correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x). (3) Execution successful - correctly displays: hostname (vps-2d421d2a), date/time with timezone, uptime (2h 12m), OS (Ubuntu 25.04), kernel (6.14.0-34-generic), CPU (Intel Haswell 4 cores), memory (825Mi/7.6Gi), disk (4% full), load average, and user count. (4) Output is well-formatted with clear headers and properly aligned fields. (5) Code review confirms: proper shebang, graceful fallback for `uptime -p`, correct parsing of /etc/os-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/loadavg, and standard commands (free, df, who). Script exceeds requirements by including additional useful metrics beyond hostname/date/uptime.

### TASK-005: Create a process memory monitor
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a script that lists the top 10 memory-consuming processes on the system
- **Notes**: Useful for identifying memory hogs on the server. Should display process name, PID, and memory usage in MB. Helps with debugging performance issues on the 7.6GB RAM server. **Assigned by PM on 2026-01-19.** Complements TASK-003 (disk monitor) for server health monitoring.
- **Completed**: 2026-01-19 by developer. Created `/home/novakj/projects/memory-monitor.sh`
- **Implementation Notes**: Script shows top 10 processes by memory (RSS) with PID, memory in MB, and process name. Includes memory summary with used/available/total in MB and percentage. Warnings at 80% (WARNING) and 90% (CRITICAL) usage thresholds. Uses /proc/meminfo and ps for reliable data.
- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Verified 2026-01-19. (1) Syntax check passed with `bash -n`. (2) Script has correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x). (3) Execution successful - correctly shows top 10 processes by RSS memory usage: claude (431 MB), fwupd (43 MB), python3 (28 MB), etc. with PID, memory in MB, and process name columns properly aligned. (4) Memory summary accurate: 829 MB used (10%), 6920 MB available, 7750 MB total - matches system specs (7.6 GB). (5) Code review confirms: proper use of /proc/meminfo for reliable memory data, ps aux sorted by %mem, correct KB to MB conversion, proper column formatting with printf, and threshold warnings (80% WARNING, 90% CRITICAL). Script meets all requirements and provides clear, actionable output.

### TASK-003: Create a disk space monitor script
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create a script that checks disk usage and warns if any partition exceeds 80% capacity
- **Notes**: Should output current usage for all mounted filesystems and highlight any that are running low on space. Useful for preventing disk-full issues. **Prioritized by PM** - important for server health monitoring. **Assigned to developer on 2026-01-19.**

- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Verified 2026-01-19. (1) Syntax check passed with `bash -n`. (2) Script has correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x). (3) Execution successful - correctly detected 3 filesystems (/, /boot, /boot/efi) all at normal levels. (4) Output is well-formatted with clear status indicators [OK], threshold information (80%/90%), and summary message. (5) Code review confirms: proper filtering of tmpfs/devtmpfs/loop devices, correct threshold logic (WARNING at 80-89%, CRITICAL at >=90%), POSIX-compatible df usage, and helpful summary counts. Script meets all requirements.

### TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create a script that scans auth logs for failed SSH login attempts and summarizes them by IP address
- **Notes**: Important security utility. Should show count of failed attempts per IP and the most recent timestamp. Helps identify potential brute-force attacks. Output should be sorted by number of attempts descending. **Assigned by PM on 2026-01-19.**
- **Completed**: 2026-01-19 by developer. Created `/home/novakj/projects/ssh-login-detector.sh`
- **Implementation Notes**: Script checks `/var/log/auth.log` (or `/var/log/secure` on RHEL). Requires sudo to read auth logs. Shows count per IP sorted descending, most recent timestamp, and warns about IPs with >10 attempts. Outputs tip for blocking suspicious IPs with UFW.
- **Tester Feedback**: [PASS] - Verified 2026-01-19. (1) Script syntax validated with `bash -n` - no errors. (2) Script has correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x). (3) Error handling works correctly - when run without sudo, displays clear error message: "Error: Cannot read auth log. Run with sudo or check permissions." (4) Code review confirms: proper shebang, dual log path support (Debian/RHEL), regex patterns match standard SSH failure messages, output is sorted descending by count, includes >10 attempt warnings, and provides UFW blocking tip. Script meets all requirements.

### TASK-001: Create a hello world script
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Assigned**: developer
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create a simple hello.py script that prints "Hello from the AI agent system!"
- **Notes**: This is our first test task. Assigned by PM on 2026-01-19.

### Security Status: 2026-01-20
- **Last review**: 2026-01-20 02:09 UTC
- **Critical issues**: 0
- **Warnings**: 2 (SSH brute force ongoing, world-writable API files)
- **Status**: NEEDS ATTENTION

**Security checks performed:**
1. [VERIFIED] nginx blocks sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return HTTP 404
2. [VERIFIED] Sensitive files have correct permissions (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, id_ed25519: 600)
3. [VERIFIED] No secrets/credentials in git history (only test-related references found)
4. [WARNING] World-writable files in web root: action-queue.json, action-status.json (needed for CGI but risk noted)
5. [VERIFIED] No symlinks in web root pointing outside web directory
6. [VERIFIED] No embedded secrets in JavaScript/HTML files (only CSS variable names for secrets-audit page)
7. [NOTE] tasks.md exposed in web root (intentional for task viewer, no secrets contained)
8. [VERIFIED] CLAUDE.md blocked via HTTP (returns 404)
9. [VERIFIED] .git directory blocked via HTTP (returns 404)
10. [VERIFIED] .env files blocked via HTTP (returns 404)
11. [VERIFIED] Disk usage healthy (4%)
12. [VERIFIED] CGI action validation uses whitelist (safe - no arbitrary command execution)

**SSH brute force status (6% increase since last check):**
- Total failed attempts: 5,607 (up from 5,282 last check - +325 attempts in ~30 min)
- Unique attacking IPs: 114 (normal churn in attacker pool)
- Top attacker IPs:
  - 164.92.216.111 (377 attempts) - PERSISTENT, most aggressive
  - 66.116.226.147 (370 attempts) - PERSISTENT, escalating
  - 94.26.106.110 (258 attempts) - PERSISTENT
  - 159.138.130.72 (247 attempts) - PERSISTENT
  - 167.99.210.155 (200 attempts)
  - 209.38.44.128 (197 attempts)
  - 206.189.111.94 (177 attempts) - NEW in top 10
  - 209.38.37.169 (176 attempts)
  - 80.94.92.40 (161 attempts)
  - 64.225.77.238 (161 attempts)

**CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS:**
1. fail2ban NOT INSTALLED - attackers are not being blocked
2. UFW firewall is INACTIVE - no rate limiting on SSH
3. SSH brute force continues unabated - ~650 attempts/hour rate

**World-writable files analysis:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-queue.json` (666 permissions)
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-status.json` (666 permissions)
- Reason: Required for CGI script (runs as www-data) to write action queue data
- Risk: Low - files only contain action status JSON, no sensitive data
- Mitigation: CGI validates action types via whitelist (only 6 predefined actions accepted)

**Recommendations (URGENT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED):**
- Install fail2ban: `sudo apt install fail2ban -y`
- Enable UFW: `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh`
- Consider changing SSH port or implementing key-only authentication
