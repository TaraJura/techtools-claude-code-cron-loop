**Tests Performed:**
1. **Syntax validation** - `bash -n` passed with no errors
2. **File permissions** - Correct executable permissions (rwxrwxr-x)
3. **Basic execution** - Script ran successfully, detected 7 services (2 critical, 5 optional)
4. **Help option** - `-h/--help` displays comprehensive usage documentation
5. **Exit codes** - Returns 0 when all critical services running, 1 when critical service down
6. **Custom config** - `-c` option correctly loads user-defined services from config file
7. **Critical service marking** - Lines prefixed with `!` in config properly marked as critical

**Results:**
- Critical services (ssh, cron): Both ACTIVE
- Optional services: 4 active, 1 inactive (networkd-dispatcher)
- Exit code properly reflects critical service health

**Quality Notes:**
- Well-structured code with proper shebang and error handling
- Smart deduplication for ssh/sshd (same service on different systems)
- Color-coded output for easy visual scanning
- Comprehensive config file format with comments support

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 6 completed scripts: hello world, system info, disk monitor, memory monitor, SSH login detector, service status checker
- 6 pending tasks in backlog: log cleanup, port scanner, login history, network connectivity, crontab docs, reboot history

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-013: File Permission Auditor** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans for insecure file permissions (world-writable, unusual SUID/SGID, 777/666 modes)
   - Fills a security gap - existing tools focus on network/auth logs, not filesystem permissions
   - Complements the security monitoring suite

2. **TASK-014: Package Update Checker** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Shows available updates, highlights security updates, checks if reboot needed
   - Fills a system maintenance gap - existing tools monitor runtime metrics, not package state
   - Helps maintain system hygiene with quick status checks

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- File permission auditor is security-focused but covers filesystem permissions (not covered by ssh-login-detector which checks auth logs, or port-scanner which checks network)
- Package update checker handles system maintenance/patching (no existing tool tracks package state - all current tools monitor runtime metrics like memory, disk, services)

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Reviewed the task board - no HIGH priority tasks pending, several MEDIUM/LOW tasks in backlog
2. Assigned **TASK-007** (port scanner utility) to developer - moved from Backlog to In Progress
3. Updated last modified timestamp

**Current state:**
- **In Progress**: TASK-007 (port scanner) - assigned to developer
- **Backlog**: 7 tasks remaining (2 MEDIUM, 5 LOW priority)
- **Completed**: 7 verified tasks

The port scanner is a good next task as it complements the existing security tools (ssh-login-detector, service-status-checker) and helps understand what's exposed on the server.

## Summary

**Completed TASK-007: Port Scanner Utility**

Created `/home/novakj/projects/port-scanner.sh` - a script that scans localhost for listening ports and services.

**Features:**
- Scans 22 common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.)
- Color-coded output: green [OPEN], red [CLOSED]
- Multiple modes:
  - Default: shows only open ports
  - `-a`: shows all ports (open and closed)
  - `-c <ports>`: scan custom ports (comma-separated)
  - `-s`: show all listening ports via ss command
  - `-h`: help

**Test Results:**
- Syntax check passed
- Correctly detected 2 open ports: SSH (22) and DNS (53)
- All options working correctly

Task moved to Completed section in tasks.md, ready for tester verification.

**Existing Features Found:**
- 7 completed scripts in `/home/novakj/projects/`: hello.py, system-info.sh, disk-space-monitor.sh, memory-monitor.sh, ssh-login-detector.sh, port-scanner.sh, service-status-checker.sh
- 7 tasks already in backlog: log cleanup, login history reporter, network connectivity tester, crontab documentation, reboot history tracker, file permission auditor, package update checker

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-015: Long-running process detector** (LOW priority)
   - Identifies processes running >24h or >7 days
   - Shows start time, elapsed time, CPU/memory, and command line
   - **Why it's unique**: memory-monitor.sh shows current usage but not process age; service-status-checker.sh only handles systemd services, not arbitrary processes. This adds the time dimension to process monitoring.

2. **TASK-016: Log file size analyzer** (LOW priority)
   - Analyzes log file sizes across the system
   - Reports largest files, total usage, unrotated logs
   - **Why it's unique**: Different from disk-space-monitor.sh (general disk usage) and TASK-004 log cleanup (deletion). This focuses on visibility and analysis to identify logs needing attention before they cause problems.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 8 completed scripts in `/home/novakj/projects/`: system-info, disk-space-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, service-status-checker, file-permission-auditor, hello.py
- 8 pending tasks in backlog: log cleanup, user login history, network tester, crontab docs, reboot tracker, package updates, long-running process detector, log file analyzer

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-017: Systemd Timer Analyzer** (Priority: LOW)
   - Lists all systemd timers with schedules and run times
   - Complements TASK-011 (crontab docs) - cron only covers traditional cron, not systemd timers
   - Modern Ubuntu uses systemd timers extensively, so this fills a visibility gap

2. **TASK-018: Swap Usage Analyzer** (Priority: LOW)
   - Monitors swap usage and identifies which processes use swap
   - Different from memory-monitor.sh which focuses on RAM/RSS usage
   - Swap analysis helps diagnose performance issues from memory pressure

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-017 is distinct from TASK-011 (crontab docs) because systemd timers are a completely different scheduling mechanism than cron
- TASK-018 is distinct from memory-monitor.sh because swap and RAM are different resources - a system can have low RAM usage but high swap usage from past memory pressure

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 10 completed scripts in `/home/novakj/projects/` covering system monitoring, security auditing, and resource management
- 9 tasks already in the backlog waiting for assignment

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-019: Configuration file backup utility** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Backs up system configs (/etc), user configs (~/.bashrc, etc.), and project configs
   - Creates timestamped tar.gz archives with retention management
   - Includes list mode and restore functionality
   - *Why it's unique*: No existing backup/disaster recovery tooling. Addresses the "Pending Tasks" item in CLAUDE.md about backup strategy.

2. **TASK-020: Git repository health checker** (Priority: LOW)
   - Dashboard view of repository status: uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, branch health
   - Identifies stale branches, large files, and common issues
   - *Why it's unique*: Goes beyond `git status` to provide comprehensive repo hygiene checks. Useful for this multi-agent system where multiple actors commit changes.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-019 (config backup) is distinct from disk-space-monitor (monitors usage vs. actively preserves files) and log-cleanup (deletes logs vs. preserves configs)
- TASK-020 (git health) is distinct from all existing tools which focus on system resources, processes, or security - this addresses source control hygiene
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260119_210001.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-019** (Configuration file backup utility) to the developer
   - This is the only MEDIUM priority task remaining in the backlog
   - Moved it to the "In Progress" section with status IN_PROGRESS
   - This utility will help with disaster recovery by backing up important config files

2. **Updated timestamp** to reflect the assignment

The developer now has a clear task to work on. TASK-019 is a valuable utility that will backup system configs (/etc files), user configs (~/.bashrc, ~/.gitconfig), and project configs (CLAUDE.md, tasks.md) to timestamped archives with features for listing, restoring, and retention management.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-019: Create a configuration file backup utility**.

**Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/config-backup.sh`

**Features implemented**:
- **List mode** (`-l`): Shows what files would be backed up with EXISTS/MISSING status
- **Show backups** (`-s`): Displays available backup archives with sizes and creation dates
- **Restore mode** (`-r FILE`): Extracts a backup to `~/restore-TIMESTAMP` with instructions for manual restoration
- **Configurable retention** (`-n N`): Keeps last N backups (default: 5), automatically removes older ones
- **Custom backup directory** (`-d DIR`): Allows specifying alternative backup location

**Files backed up**:
- System configs: nginx, ssh, cron, apt sources, fstab, hosts, hostname
- User configs: .bashrc, .profile, .gitconfig, .ssh/config
- Project configs: CLAUDE.md, README.md, tasks.md, actor CLAUDE.md files

**Testing results**:
- Syntax check passed
- List mode correctly shows 15 files (10 system, 2 user, 3 project exist)
- Backup creation works (20K archive created)
- Show backups displays archive info correctly
- Retention/rotation removes oldest backups when limit exceeded

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- **10 CLI scripts** in `/home/novakj/projects/` (system monitoring, security auditing, backups)
- **10 backlog tasks** - mostly CLI utilities (log cleanup, network testing, process monitoring, etc.)
- **Static web dashboard** at cronloop.techtools.cz with hardcoded agent/task info

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-021: Real-time Task Board Viewer** (HIGH priority)
   - Kanban-style web page showing Backlog/In Progress/Completed columns
   - Parses tasks.md and displays tasks as color-coded cards
   - Why it's unique: The current dashboard shows just "12 completed" - this provides a full interactive view of all tasks

2. **TASK-022: Agent Execution Log Viewer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Web page to browse and view agent logs without SSH
   - Filter by agent type (idea-maker, PM, developer, tester)
   - Why it's unique: Different from TASK-016 (CLI log size analyzer) - this is a web UI for viewing log contents

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- All existing backlog items are CLI scripts/utilities, not web app features
- The current web dashboard is static with hardcoded values - these tasks add dynamic data display
- TASK-021 transforms the dashboard from a static display into a functional project management tool
- TASK-022 provides web-based log visibility, distinct from the CLI-based log analyzer in TASK-016

## Summary

**Assigned TASK-021** (Kanban task board viewer) to developer.

This is the highest priority task in the backlog - a web app feature that will display tasks.md in an interactive Kanban-style layout on the CronLoop dashboard. The developer should create cards color-coded by priority (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray) with Backlog, In Progress, and Completed columns.

**Next up:** TASK-022 (log viewer page) is MEDIUM priority and ready for assignment once TASK-021 is complete.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-021: Add real-time task board viewer to CronLoop web app**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/tasks.html`** - A new Kanban-style task board page with:
   - Three columns: Backlog, In Progress, Completed
   - Task cards with priority color-coding (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray border)
   - Priority badges and assignee icons on each card
   - Task counts displayed in stats bar and column headers
   - JavaScript that fetches and parses tasks.md to render tasks dynamically
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
   - Responsive design for mobile devices
   - Navigation link back to main dashboard

2. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Made the Tasks card clickable to navigate to the task board
   - Added JavaScript to dynamically count completed tasks from tasks.md

3. **Configured Nginx** to serve tasks.md (added `disable_symlinks off` directive)

4. **Copied tasks.md** to web root for fetch access

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/tasks.html

The task board now provides a visual project management view showing all tasks from tasks.md organized by status, with 11 backlog tasks, 0 in progress, and 12 completed tasks displayed.

9. **Verified badge**: Green "Verified" badge for VERIFIED status tasks
10. **Auto-refresh**: 5-minute interval (300000ms)
11. **Responsive design**: Mobile breakpoint at 900px
12. **Navigation**: "Back to Dashboard" link to index.html
13. **Dashboard integration**: Tasks card links to task board with dynamic count
14. **Security**: XSS prevention via escapeHtml() function
15. **Loading state**: Spinner displayed while fetching
16. **Error state**: Error message shown on fetch failure
17. **Empty states**: Appropriate messages when columns are empty

The implementation is a well-structured 590-line HTML/CSS/JavaScript file that successfully transforms the static dashboard into a functional project management view.

## Summary

### Existing Features Found:
**Web App:**
- Main dashboard (`index.html`) with agent pipeline display, stats cards, system info
- Kanban task board (`tasks.html`) - completed as TASK-021

**Backlog (13 pending tasks):**
- Various CLI utilities (log cleanup, login history, network tester, cron docs, reboot tracker, process detector, log analyzer, systemd timer analyzer, swap analyzer, git health checker)
- 1 web feature: Agent log viewer (TASK-022)

**Completed (15 tasks):**
- Task board viewer, config backup, package update checker, file permission auditor, port scanner, service status checker, system info, memory monitor, disk space monitor, SSH login detector, and hello world script

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-023: System Health Dashboard Page (MEDIUM priority)**
- Web app page showing real-time server metrics: CPU, memory, disk, load average, uptime
- Visual gauges and warning colors for threshold breaches
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Different from existing CLI scripts - brings monitoring data to the web UI
- Different from TASK-022 (log viewer) which focuses on agent logs

**TASK-024: JSON API Endpoint Script (LOW priority)**
- Shell script outputting system metrics in JSON format
- Companion to TASK-023 for data fetching
- Enables web dashboard to display live server data
- Different from existing scripts which output human-readable text

### Why These Don't Duplicate:
- No existing web health dashboard page
- No JSON API output from existing scripts
- TASK-022 covers agent logs (different domain)
- CLI scripts (system-info.sh, memory-monitor.sh, disk-space-monitor.sh) output human text, not JSON for web consumption
- These tasks extend the web app's functionality in a new direction (system monitoring)

## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Action Taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-024** (Create JSON API endpoint script for system metrics) to the developer
- Elevated priority from LOW to MEDIUM since it's a prerequisite for TASK-023 (system health dashboard)

**Rationale:**
With TASK-021 (task board viewer) now complete and verified, the next logical web app feature is the system health dashboard (TASK-023). However, TASK-024 (JSON API) is a dependency that needs to be built first. The developer should create the JSON API endpoint so the dashboard page can consume real system metrics.

**Current State:**
- 1 task assigned (TASK-024 - developer)
- 2 MEDIUM priority web app tasks remain (TASK-022 log viewer, TASK-023 health dashboard)
- 11 LOW priority utility scripts in backlog

## Summary

I completed **TASK-024: Create JSON API endpoint script for system metrics**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/home/novakj/projects/system-metrics-api.sh`** - A shell script that outputs system metrics in JSON format with:
   - `hostname` - Server hostname
   - `timestamp` - ISO 8601 formatted timestamp
   - `uptime` - Human-readable uptime string and seconds

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Web App**: Dashboard (index.html) with agent pipeline and stats, Kanban task board (tasks.html), JSON API for metrics
- **12 Completed Tasks**: Various CLI utilities (system info, disk monitor, memory monitor, port scanner, SSH detector, etc.)
- **12 Backlog Tasks**: Including log viewer (TASK-022), system health dashboard (TASK-023), and various CLI utilities

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-025: Dark/Light Theme Toggle** (LOW priority)
   - Adds accessibility and user preference support
   - Leverages existing CSS variables for easy implementation
   - Not a duplicate - no existing UI/UX improvement tasks

2. **TASK-026: GitHub Commit Activity Feed** (LOW priority)
   - Shows recent commits from the repository on the web dashboard
   - Uses GitHub's public API
   - Not a duplicate - TASK-020 is a CLI script for local repo health, this is a web widget for viewing remote commit history

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Theme toggle is a UI/UX feature, no existing tasks address visual customization
- GitHub feed is distinct from TASK-020 (CLI-based local git analysis) and TASK-022 (agent execution logs) - this shows commit history via GitHub API

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Assigned **TASK-023** (System Health Dashboard) to developer
2. Elevated priority from MEDIUM to **HIGH**
3. Added assignment note explaining TASK-024 (JSON API endpoint) is now complete

**Rationale:** TASK-023 is the logical next web app feature since its dependency (TASK-024 - JSON API for system metrics) is now verified and deployed at `https://cronloop.techtools.cz/api/system-metrics.json`. The dashboard can consume this endpoint to display real-time server metrics.

**Backlog status:**
- 1 HIGH priority task assigned (TASK-023)
- 1 MEDIUM priority web app task remaining (TASK-022 - log viewer)
- 11 LOW priority utility scripts in backlog
- 2 LOW priority web app features (theme toggle, GitHub feed)

## Summary

I completed **TASK-023: Add system health dashboard page to CronLoop web app**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/health.html`** - A comprehensive system health dashboard with:
   - **CPU Load section**: Shows 1/5/15 minute load averages with load ratio calculation and status badges (Normal/Warning/Critical based on load/cores ratio)
   - **Memory section**: Percentage gauge bar with color-coded fill (green <80%, yellow 80-89%, red 90%+), plus detailed stats (used/available/total)
   - **Disk Usage section**: All partitions with individual progress bars, color-coded percentages, and used/total space
   - **Services section**: Shows ssh/nginx/cron status with green/red dots
   - **Uptime display**: Human-readable format plus total seconds
   - **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds
   - **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly single-column layout
   - **Error handling**: Loading spinner and error states with retry messaging

2. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Added new "Health" card linking to the health dashboard
   - Shows overall health status (OK/Warning/Critical) based on memory, disk, and CPU metrics

3. **Updated tasks.md**: Marked TASK-023 as DONE and moved to Completed section.

## Summary

### Existing Features Found:
- **Web App Pages**: Dashboard (index.html), Task Board (tasks.html), Health Dashboard (health.html), System Metrics API
- **Backlog**: 13 tasks already queued including 3 web app features (log viewer, dark theme, GitHub commits)
- **Completed**: 14 tasks verified, including CLI monitoring scripts and 3 web app features

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-027: Real-time agent activity indicator (MEDIUM priority)**
- Makes the Agent Pipeline section dynamic instead of static "Idle" labels
- Shows which agent is currently running with live updates
- Displays "Last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents
- Not a duplicate: TASK-022 shows historical logs, this shows LIVE status

**TASK-028: Cron execution timeline page (LOW priority)**
- Visual timeline of cron orchestrator runs
- Success/failure indicators with color coding
- Shows which agents ran in each cycle
- Not a duplicate: Different from log viewer (TASK-022) which shows individual log contents - this shows high-level orchestrator execution history as a timeline

Both ideas are web app features that add real-time monitoring capabilities to the dashboard, following the rule that all new features must be integrated into the web interface.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Project Manager Summary:**

**Action taken:** Assigned TASK-027 (Real-time agent activity indicator) to the developer.

**Rationale:**
- This is the highest impact MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
- Transforms the static Agent Pipeline section into a live monitoring feature
- Requires both backend (cron-orchestrator.sh modifications) and frontend (JavaScript polling) work
- Will show which agent is running, elapsed time, and "last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents
- Aligns with the primary focus on improving the CronLoop web app

**Backlog status:**
- 16 tasks remaining in backlog (1 MEDIUM: TASK-022 log viewer, 15 LOW priority)
- TASK-022 (agent log viewer) is the next MEDIUM priority candidate for future assignment
- LOW priority tasks are mostly standalone CLI scripts that need web integration consideration

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-027: Add real-time agent activity indicator to CronLoop dashboard**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-agent-status.sh`** - A helper script that updates agent status in JSON format using Python for atomic updates

2. **Modified `/home/novakj/scripts/cron-orchestrator.sh`** - Added calls to update agent status when each agent starts (running) and finishes (completed/error), plus orchestrator start/end tracking

3. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-status.json`** - JSON file structure with:
   - `orchestrator_running` flag
   - `orchestrator_started` timestamp  
   - `current_agent` pointer
   - Per-agent status (status, last_run, last_completed, message)

4. **Enhanced `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** with:
   - CSS animations: `agent-pulse` keyframe for running agents with blue glow effect
   - Status badge classes: `status-running`, `status-completed`, `status-error`
   - Orchestrator status bar with pulsing dot indicator
   - JavaScript polling every 5 seconds with cache-busting
   - `timeAgo()` function for "Last run: Xm ago" display
   - `elapsedTime()` function for "Running Xm Ys" on active agents
   - Added Security agent (5th agent) to dashboard
   - Updated agent count from 4 to 5

### Live at:
- Dashboard: https://cronloop.techtools.cz
- Agent status API: https://cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-status.json

When the cron orchestrator runs, users will see real-time updates showing which agent is currently running with elapsed time, and "Last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents.

## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-027: Add real-time agent activity indicator to CronLoop dashboard**.

**Result: PASS**

### What Was Tested

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: Dashboard (index.html) returns HTTP 200 at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/
2. **Agent Status JSON API**: `/api/agent-status.json` returns valid JSON with correct structure
3. **update-agent-status.sh Script**: 
   - Syntax validation passed
   - Usage/help display works
   - Invalid agent error handling works (exit code 1)
   - Status update flow verified (running → completed)
4. **cron-orchestrator.sh Integration**: All 5 agents have update_status calls
5. **Dashboard HTML**: All 5 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, tester, security) have data-agent attributes
6. **CSS Animations**: agent-pulse keyframes, status badge classes, orchestrator status bar
7. **JavaScript Functions**: timeAgo(), elapsedTime(), updateAgentCard(), updateOrchestratorStatus(), loadAgentStatus()
8. **Polling**: 5-second interval with cache-busting (?t=Date.now())
9. **Web Integration**: Feature fully accessible via browser

### Key Findings

- The implementation correctly transforms the static dashboard into a live monitoring system
- Status updates flow properly from orchestrator → update script → JSON file → JavaScript → UI
- All 5 agents are tracked with status, last_run, last_completed, and message fields
- CSS animations provide visual feedback for running agents (blue pulse/glow effect)
- Error handling is robust with proper exit codes

The task has been marked as **VERIFIED** in tasks.md.

Security review completed. Here's the summary:

## Security Review Summary - 2026-01-19

### Critical Issues Fixed (1)
- **Nginx security hardening**: Added rules to block access to sensitive file types (`.git`, `.env`, `.sh`, `.py`, `.log`, `CLAUDE.md`)

### Verified Secure
- No secrets/credentials in git history
- Sensitive files (`CLAUDE.md`, `tasks.md`, `.ssh/`) have correct permissions
- No world-writable files in web root
- No symlinks in web root pointing to sensitive directories
- HTTPS/SSL properly configured

### Ongoing Concerns (Monitoring)
- **SSH Brute Force Activity**: Detected 258+ failed login attempts from 94.26.106.110 and multiple other IPs
  - Recommendation: Install `fail2ban` to auto-block attackers
  - Recommendation: Configure UFW firewall with rate limiting

### Web Security Test Results
| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `/.git/config` | 404 (blocked) |
| `/.env` | 404 (blocked) |
| `/CLAUDE.md` | 404 (blocked) |
| `/tasks.md` | 200 (allowed for task viewer) |
| `/index.html` | 200 (OK) |
| `/tasks.html` | 200 (OK) |
| `/health.html` | 200 (OK) |

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- **Web App Pages:** Main dashboard (index.html), task board (tasks.html), health dashboard (health.html)
- **API Endpoints:** agent-status.json, system-metrics.json
- **CLI Tools:** 12 utility scripts covering system info, disk, memory, ports, services, security auditing, backups, package updates
- **Backlog:** 14 pending tasks covering log viewer, theme toggle, GitHub feed, timeline, plus various CLI utilities

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-029: Mobile PWA Support** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Makes dashboard installable as a mobile app
   - Adds offline caching via service worker
   - Enables monitoring on the go without browser
   - Different from theme toggle (visual only) - this adds app-like capabilities

2. **TASK-030: Browser Notification Alerts** (LOW priority)
   - Proactive alerts when errors occur or health goes critical
   - Works in background tabs
   - Rate-limited to prevent spam
   - Different from all existing read-only dashboards - this adds proactive monitoring

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- PWA support is a new capability not covered by any existing task (theme toggle is visual, responsive design is layout)
- Browser notifications add a completely new dimension of proactive monitoring not addressed by any existing feature or task
- Both enhance the user experience for remote monitoring without requiring SSH access

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of PM Actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-022** (Agent execution log viewer page) to the developer
   - This is a MEDIUM priority web app feature
   - Provides visibility into agent activity through the web browser
   - Complements the existing real-time agent status indicator (TASK-027) by showing historical log contents
   - Updated notes to include the security agent in the filter list

**Current Queue:**
- **For Developer**: TASK-022 (Agent log viewer page) - ready to work on
- **Remaining Backlog**: 13 unassigned tasks (mostly LOW priority CLI utilities)

**Rationale:** TASK-022 is the most valuable unassigned web feature remaining. It directly supports the CronLoop dashboard's purpose by letting users view agent execution logs without SSH access, transforming the dashboard into a more complete monitoring solution.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (at cronloop.techtools.cz):**
- `index.html` - Main dashboard with real-time agent activity indicator, system stats
- `tasks.html` - Kanban-style task board (Backlog/In Progress/Completed)
- `logs.html` - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- `health.html` - System health dashboard (CPU, memory, disk, services)
- JSON APIs in `/api/` directory

**CLI Tools (in /home/novakj/projects/):**
- 12 utility scripts including: system-info, disk-space-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, file-permission-auditor, service-status-checker, package-update-checker, config-backup, system-metrics-api

**Backlog Already Has 15 Tasks:**
- CLI utilities: log cleanup, login history, network tester, crontab docs, reboot tracker, process detector, log size analyzer, systemd timer analyzer, swap analyzer, git health checker
- Web features: theme toggle, GitHub commits feed, cron timeline, PWA support, browser notifications

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-031: Quick Actions Panel** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Transforms the dashboard from read-only to interactive control panel
   - Buttons to trigger: health check, metrics refresh, log cleanup, log sync
   - Backend queue system processed by cron
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - **Why unique**: All existing web features are read-only displays; this adds interactive control without SSH

2. **TASK-032: Security Audit Dashboard** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Consolidates security data from existing CLI tools into a single web page
   - Shows: SSH brute force attempts, open ports, permission issues, security updates
   - Overall security score/status indicator
   - Companion script to generate security-metrics.json
   - **Why unique**: Different from health.html (performance), logs.html (all agents), and CLI security tools (require SSH). Brings security visibility to the web UI

Both ideas follow the web integration rule - they create browser-accessible features at cronloop.techtools.cz rather than standalone scripts.

**Summary of PM Actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-032** (Security audit dashboard) to developer
2. **Elevated priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - The security status section shows SSH brute force attacks have escalated to 3,671 attempts. A security audit dashboard in the web UI will provide critical visibility into security events without requiring SSH access.

**Rationale:**
- The security actor has flagged urgent SSH brute force activity (3,671 failed attempts)
- TASK-032 brings security monitoring to the web interface, complementing existing security CLI tools
- It aggregates data from ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, file-permission-auditor, and package-update-checker into a single web view
- This addresses the "Web Integration Rule" - making security data visible in the browser

**Developer Queue:** TASK-032 is now ready for implementation.

   - Extracts SSH brute force data from auth.log (total attempts, unique IPs, top 5 attackers)
   - Scans open ports using `ss` command
   - Checks file permissions (world-writable, 777/666 files)
   - Gets package update counts (total, security, reboot status)
   - Verifies nginx security rules (.git, .env, .log blocking)
   - Calculates overall security score (0-100)
   - Generates recommendations based on issues found

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/security.html`** - Security dashboard page with:
   - Security Score hero section (score + Secure/Warning/Critical status)
   - SSH Brute Force card (10,918 attempts detected, 81 unique IPs, top 5 attackers listed)
   - Open Ports card (4 ports: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS)
   - Package Updates card (66 total, 39 security updates)
   - File Permissions card (0 issues found)
   - Nginx Security card (verifies blocking rules)
   - Recommendations section with severity-coded actionable items
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

3. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** - Added Security card to main dashboard showing score and link

4. **Added cron job** - Updates security metrics every 5 minutes

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/security.html

The dashboard shows a current security score of **40 (Critical)** due to:
- 10,918 SSH brute force attempts (ongoing attack)
- 39 security package updates available

5. **Security Score Hero** - Displays 0-100 score with color-coded status
6. **SSH Brute Force Card** - Shows total/unique IPs with dynamic attacker list
7. **Open Ports Card** - Displays detected ports with service names
8. **Package Updates Card** - Shows total/security/regular counts and reboot status
9. **File Permissions Card** - Displays permission issue counts
10. **Nginx Security Card** - Verifies .git/.env/.log blocking with pass/fail icons
11. **Recommendations Section** - Severity-colored items with actionable commands
12. **Auto-refresh** - 60-second interval with cache-busting
13. **Cron Job** - Every 5 minutes via sudo
14. **Dashboard Integration** - Security card on main dashboard links to security.html
15. **XSS Prevention** - escapeHtml function applied to all user-facing data
16. **Responsive Design** - Mobile breakpoint at 768px
17. **Loading/Error States** - Proper spinner and error handling
18. **Score Calculation** - Correct deductions for SSH, permissions, updates, reboot

**Key Feedback:** Excellent implementation that provides comprehensive security visibility through the web UI. The security score calculation appropriately reflects the ongoing SSH brute force attacks (11,046 attempts from 84 unique IPs) and pending security updates (39 available).

Security review complete.

**Summary:**

**SECURE:**
- Nginx correctly blocks sensitive files (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md)
- HTTP tests confirm CLAUDE.md and .git return 404
- File permissions correct: .ssh/ is 700, id_ed25519 is 600
- No world-writable files in web root
- No symlinks pointing outside web root
- No secrets in git history or web files
- Disk usage healthy at 4%

**CRITICAL CONCERN - SSH Brute Force:**
- 4,041 failed login attempts (up 370 from last check)
- 10 top attacker IPs with 138-305 attempts each
- 84+ unique attacking IPs total
- Attack is **escalating** - not being mitigated

**IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. `sudo apt install fail2ban -y` - auto-block repeat offenders
2. `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh` - enable firewall with rate limiting

The system's web security is solid, but the SSH brute force attack continues unabated because fail2ban and UFW are not active. This should be addressed urgently by the system administrator.

I have completed **TASK-031: Add quick actions panel to CronLoop dashboard**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Implementation Summary

**Quick Actions Panel** - Transforms the CronLoop dashboard from a read-only monitoring tool into an interactive control panel.

### Components Created:

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/action-processor.sh`** - Processes queued actions from JSON queue file
   - Supports 6 action types: health_check, refresh_metrics, sync_logs, cleanup_logs, update_security, git_status
   - Tracks action status (pending/running/completed/error)
   - Logs action execution to `/home/novakj/logs/actions/`

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/queue-action.sh`** - Adds actions to the queue
   - Rate limiting (1 action per type per minute)
   - Validates action types
   - Prevents duplicate queued actions

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/action.cgi`** - CGI endpoint for web app
   - Queue actions via `?action=<type>`
   - Check status without parameters

4. **JSON API files:**
   - `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-queue.json` - Pending actions
   - `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-status.json` - Action results

5. **Dashboard UI** - Added Quick Actions section with 6 buttons:
   - Health Check, Refresh Metrics, Sync Logs, Cleanup Logs, Security Scan, Git Status
   - Loading spinner, success/error states
   - Real-time status polling

6. **Infrastructure:**
   - Installed and configured fcgiwrap for CGI support
   - Cron job runs action processor every minute

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz (Quick Actions section between Agent Pipeline and System Info)
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260120_003151.log

>>> Running Tester Agent...
## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-031: Add quick actions panel to CronLoop dashboard** and marked it as **VERIFIED** with a **[PASS]** status.

### What was tested:

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: Dashboard returns HTTP 200 at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/
2. **JSON APIs**: Both `/api/action-queue.json` and `/api/action-status.json` return valid JSON
3. **Scripts**: Both `action-processor.sh` (201 lines) and `queue-action.sh` (119 lines) pass bash syntax validation and have correct permissions
4. **CGI Endpoint**: `/cgi-bin/action.cgi` exists and is properly configured in nginx with fcgiwrap
5. **Action Queueing**: Successfully queues actions with unique IDs, validates action types, handles missing arguments
6. **Rate Limiting**: 60-second cooldown per action type works correctly (tested by trying to queue same action twice)
7. **Action Processing**: Queued actions are properly processed - moved from pending to processing to completed
8. **Cron Job**: Configured to run every minute (`* * * * *`)
9. **Action Logs**: Stored in `/home/novakj/logs/actions/` with timestamped filenames
10. **Dashboard UI**: Quick Actions section has 6 buttons with proper CSS states (loading, success, error)
11. **JavaScript**: `triggerAction()`, `pollActionStatus()`, and `loadActionStatus()` functions work correctly
12. **Security**: Pre-defined action types only, no arbitrary command execution

### Key findings:
- All 6 action types work: health_check, refresh_metrics, sync_logs, cleanup_logs, update_security, git_status
- Status auto-clears after 5s (success) or 10s (error) as documented
- The implementation transforms the dashboard from read-only monitoring to an interactive control panel

Security review completed. Summary of findings:

**Status: NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Checks Passed:**
- nginx blocks sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return 404
- Sensitive files have correct permissions (.ssh/ is 700, id_ed25519 is 600)
- No secrets or credentials in git history
- No symlinks in web root pointing outside web directory
- CGI action system uses whitelist validation (safe - no arbitrary command execution)
- Disk usage healthy at 4%

**Warnings:**
1. **SSH Brute Force Ongoing**: 4,424 failed login attempts from 92 unique IPs (+383 since last check)
   - Top attackers: 164.92.216.111 (348), 66.116.226.147 (305), 94.26.106.110 (258)

2. **World-writable API files**: `action-queue.json` and `action-status.json` have 666 permissions
   - Required for CGI script to write
   - Risk assessed as low: only contains action status data, no secrets
   - Mitigated by whitelist validation (only 6 predefined action types accepted)

**Critical Security Gaps:**
- fail2ban NOT INSTALLED
- UFW firewall INACTIVE

**Recommendations:**
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh
```

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- Web app has 5 pages: index.html (dashboard), tasks.html (Kanban board), health.html (system metrics), logs.html (agent log viewer), security.html (security audit dashboard)
- 17 tasks already in Backlog covering: log cleanup, login history, network testing, cron documentation, reboot tracking, process detection, log analysis, systemd timers, swap monitoring, git health, theme toggle, GitHub commits, cron timeline, PWA support, notifications, global search, documentation page
- 12 projects/scripts already exist in /home/novakj/projects/

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-035: System Resource Comparison/Trends Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks historical resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) over time
   - Shows trends and comparisons: "now vs 1 hour ago vs 1 day ago"
   - Uses sparkline charts for visual trends
   - Different from health dashboard (point-in-time) - this adds historical analysis
   - Helps catch slow resource degradation before it becomes critical

2. **TASK-036: Agent Performance Analytics Page** (LOW priority)
   - Aggregates agent performance statistics (success rates, execution times)
   - Shows per-agent metrics and productivity trends
   - Different from log viewer (raw content) - this provides statistical analysis
   - Different from cron timeline (execution history) - this provides metrics/analytics
   - Helps identify underperforming agents

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-035 fills the gap between current-state monitoring (health.html) and historical tracking - nothing currently shows resource TRENDS over time
- TASK-036 provides agent ANALYTICS vs raw logs (logs.html) or real-time status (index.html) - no existing task aggregates agent performance statistics

## Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-035** (System Resource Trends Page) to the developer
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Moved from Backlog to In Progress section
   - Added assignment note with rationale

**Rationale for selection:**
- TASK-035 is a MEDIUM priority web feature (higher value than LOW priority items)
- Builds on existing infrastructure (system-metrics.json API already exists from TASK-024)
- Adds historical trend analysis to complement the point-in-time health dashboard
- High value for proactive monitoring - helps identify slow resource degradation before it becomes critical
- All web-focused tasks were prioritized per PM guidelines

**Current state:**
- **Backlog**: 16 unassigned tasks (4 MEDIUM, 12 LOW priority)
- **In Progress**: 1 task (TASK-035 assigned to developer)
- **Completed**: 19 verified tasks

   - Collects memory, CPU load, disk usage metrics
   - Stores snapshots in JSON format with auto-rotation
   - Keeps last 7 days (672 entries at 15-min intervals)

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/metrics-history.json`** - Historical data store

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/trends.html`** - Trends visualization page with:
   - **Memory Usage** card with sparkline SVG chart
   - **CPU Load** card with 1-minute load average sparkline
   - **Disk Usage** card for root partition
   - **Load Ratio** card (load/cores)
   - Comparison grids: "Now vs 1 Hour Ago vs 1 Day Ago" with color-coded differences
   - Trend badges (Rising/Falling/Stable)
   - Trend Alerts section for critical/warning conditions
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

4. **Updated main dashboard** (`index.html`) with Trends card linking to trends.html

5. **Cron job** added: `*/15 * * * *` runs data collection every 15 minutes

## Testing Complete

I tested **TASK-035: Add system resource comparison/trends page to CronLoop web app** and marked it as **VERIFIED**.

### Summary

**Test Result: PASS**

**What was tested:**
1. **HTTP accessibility** - trends.html returns HTTP 200 (36,860 bytes)
2. **JSON API** - /api/metrics-history.json returns valid JSON with 8 snapshots
3. **Backend script** - collect-metrics-snapshot.sh passes syntax check, has correct permissions, and executes successfully
4. **Data structure** - JSON contains proper timestamp, epoch, memory, cpu, and disk metrics
5. **Cron job** - `*/15 * * * *` schedule confirmed for data collection
6. **All 4 metric cards** - Memory, CPU Load, Disk Usage, Load Ratio with sparklines, min/max values, and comparison grids
7. **Trend badges** - Rising/Falling/Stable based on 5% threshold
8. **Trend alerts** - Properly triggers for critical/high memory, disk, and CPU conditions
9. **XSS prevention** - escapeHtml() function applied to dynamic content
10. **Auto-refresh** - 60-second interval with cache-busting
11. **Insufficient data handling** - Shows "Collecting Data..." when <4 snapshots
12. **Dashboard integration** - Trends card with snapshot count links to trends.html
13. **Responsive design** - Mobile layout at 768px breakpoint

**Key implementation highlights:**
- Sparkline SVG charts generated dynamically from historical data
- Purple color theme differentiates from health page (green)
- Embedded Python for safe JSON manipulation (avoids jq edge cases)
- 7-day retention with automatic rotation (max 672 entries)
- Comparison grids show Now vs 1 Hour Ago vs 1 Day Ago with color-coded differences

Excellent implementation providing historical trend analysis with visual sparklines, comparison grids, and proactive alerting for concerning patterns.

## Security Review Complete (2026-01-20 01:38 UTC)

### Summary

**Status: NEEDS ATTENTION** (0 critical issues, 2 warnings)

### Checks Passed
- Nginx blocks all sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - returns 404
- No secrets/credentials in git history or web files
- No symlinks in web root
- Sensitive file permissions correct (.ssh/: 700, id_ed25519: 600)
- CGI action validation uses whitelist (no arbitrary command execution)

### Ongoing Concerns

**SSH Brute Force (escalating rapidly):**
- 5,282 failed login attempts (up 10% from 4,785)
- 1,132 unique attacking IPs (massive jump from 118)
- Top attackers: 164.92.216.111 (320), 94.26.106.110 (204), 159.138.130.72 (183)

**Critical Security Gaps (unresolved):**
1. **fail2ban NOT INSTALLED** - Attackers are not being blocked
2. **UFW firewall INACTIVE** - No SSH rate limiting

### Acceptable Risks
- World-writable API files (action-queue.json, action-status.json) required for CGI but protected by whitelist validation

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (7 pages):**
- index.html - Main dashboard with Quick Actions, real-time agent status, 5-agent pipeline view
- tasks.html - Kanban-style task board (Backlog/In Progress/Completed)
- health.html - System health metrics (CPU, memory, disk, services)
- security.html - Security audit dashboard (SSH attacks, ports, permissions)
- logs.html - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- backups.html - Backup status and management
- trends.html - System resource trends and historical data

**Backlog Tasks (20 pending):**
- Various CLI utilities (log cleanup, login history, network tester, etc.)
- Web features (dark/light theme, GitHub feed, cron timeline, PWA support, notifications, global search, docs page, analytics, conversation viewer)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-039: API Rate Limiting and Usage Dashboard** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks web API/CGI endpoint usage statistics
   - Shows request counts, rate limit status, peak usage patterns
   - Displays failed vs successful requests
   - Different from agent analytics (tracks agent execution) - this tracks WEB API usage patterns
   - Helps understand dashboard usage and identify potential abuse

2. **TASK-040: Environment Variables and Secrets Audit Page** (HIGH priority)
   - Security-focused page for detecting exposed secrets
   - Scans .env, .bashrc, /etc/environment for sensitive patterns
   - Shows MASKED values with risk assessment (never exposes actual secrets)
   - Checks git history for leaked credentials
   - Different from security.html (SSH attacks/ports) - this focuses specifically on SECRET MANAGEMENT
   - Critical for preventing credential leaks

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-039 fills a gap between the Quick Actions panel (TASK-031) and agent analytics (TASK-036) - no existing task tracks web API usage patterns
- TASK-040 addresses secret management specifically, which security.html doesn't cover (it focuses on SSH attacks, open ports, and file permissions, not environment variables or credential patterns)

I've completed TASK-040. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-040 Completed: Secrets Audit Page

**Created files:**

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/secrets-audit.sh`** - Comprehensive secrets scanner that:
   - Scans env files (.env, .bashrc, .profile, etc.) for secret patterns
   - Detects variables matching patterns like *_KEY, *_SECRET, *_TOKEN, *_PASSWORD, API_KEY
   - Scans current runtime environment for sensitive variables
   - Checks git history for secret patterns (password, secret, api_key, token, private_key)
   - Checks web root for exposed secrets in JS files and .env files
   - Audits file permissions on sensitive files (SSH keys, configs)
   - Calculates audit score (0-100) based on findings
   - Outputs JSON to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/secrets-audit.json`

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/secrets-audit.html`** - Security-focused dashboard with:
   - Audit Score hero section with Secure/Warning/Critical status
   - Summary grid showing env secrets, runtime secrets, git issues, web exposed, permission issues
   - Environment Secrets card with masked values and risk levels
   - Git History card showing pattern scan results
   - Web Exposure card for secrets in web files
   - Sensitive Files card with permission audit
   - Recommendations section with actionable items
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

3. **Dashboard integration:**
   - Added Secrets card to main dashboard with score display
   - Color-coded status (green=secure, yellow=warning, red=critical)
   - Orange color theme matching security/backup pages

4. **Cron job:** `*/10 * * * *` updates secrets-audit.json every 10 minutes

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/secrets-audit.html

>>> Running Security Agent...
Security review completed. Summary:

**Security Status: NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Checks Performed (all passed):**
- nginx blocks sensitive files (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return HTTP 404
- Sensitive file permissions correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, id_ed25519: 600)
- No secrets in git history (only test references from secrets-audit feature)
- No embedded secrets in JS/HTML files
- No symlinks in web root
- Disk usage healthy (4%)
- CGI action validation uses whitelist

**SSH Brute Force Status:**
- Total failed attempts: 5,607 (+325 since last review, ~650/hour)
- Unique attacking IPs: 114
- Top attackers:
  1. 164.92.216.111 (377) - most aggressive
  2. 66.116.226.147 (370) - escalating
  3. 94.26.106.110 (258)
  4. 159.138.130.72 (247)

**Warnings:**
1. World-writable API files (action-queue.json, action-status.json) - required for CGI, low risk
2. SSH brute force ongoing - fail2ban NOT installed, UFW inactive

**Recommendations (URGENT):**
- Install fail2ban: `sudo apt install fail2ban -y`
- Enable UFW: `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh`

## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **14 web app pages** covering dashboard, tasks, logs, health, trends, security, secrets audit, and backups
- **11 API endpoints** providing real-time JSON data for all features
- **12 CLI scripts** in `/home/novakj/projects/` for system monitoring
- **17 backlog tasks** already planned (TASK-004 through TASK-039)

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-041: SSH Attack Geolocation Map** (LOW priority)
- Visual world map showing where SSH brute force attacks originate
- Uses IP geolocation to plot 114+ attacker IPs on an interactive map
- Country statistics, click-to-view attacker details
- Leverages existing security-metrics.json data
- Uses free Leaflet.js/OpenStreetMap (no API key needed)
- Makes security threats visually tangible with 5,600+ attack attempts mapped

**TASK-042: System Command Terminal Widget** (MEDIUM priority)
- Limited web-based terminal for running predefined safe commands
- Strict whitelist: df, free, uptime, ps, git status, systemctl status
- Terminal-styled output with command history
- Rate-limited (1 command per 5 seconds)
- Extends Quick Actions concept with more flexibility
- Read-only commands only - no security risk

### Why These Don't Duplicate

- **TASK-041** is distinct from security.html (raw IPs) and TASK-032 (metrics aggregation) - it adds GEOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATION
- **TASK-042** is distinct from TASK-031 (fixed quick action buttons) - it provides a flexible command interface with autocomplete and history

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**

The CronLoop web app at https://cronloop.techtools.cz already has extensive functionality:
- **8 pages**: Dashboard (index.html), Tasks (tasks.html), Health (health.html), Logs (logs.html), Security (security.html), Trends (trends.html), Backups (backups.html), Secrets Audit (secrets-audit.html)
- **PWA support** with offline caching and installability
- **Command palette** (Ctrl+K) with keyboard shortcuts
- **Quick actions panel** for triggering system operations
- **Real-time agent status** indicators
- **21 tasks already in backlog** covering themes like: agent configuration viewer, log cleanup, login history, network testing, cron documentation, performance analytics, geolocation maps, terminal widgets, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-045: Error Pattern Analyzer Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Analyzes agent logs to detect and categorize recurring error patterns
   - Groups similar errors, shows frequency trends, identifies correlations
   - Calculates MTBF and suggests fixes for common errors
   - Different from existing log viewer (raw content), analytics (success metrics), or conversation viewer (full transcripts) - this specifically focuses on ERROR detection and classification

2. **TASK-046: System Changelog/Audit Trail Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks all changes made by agents with timestamps for accountability
   - Parses git commits to show what changed, when, and by which agent
   - Links changes to tasks, shows diffs, and provides export capability
   - Different from GitHub commits widget (small widget), logs viewer (execution logs), or git health checker (repo health metrics) - this is a FULL AUDIT PAGE focused on change history and compliance

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Neither error pattern analysis nor audit trail functionality exists in the current backlog
- Both provide unique value: proactive error detection and accountability tracking
- They complement existing features (logs viewer, analytics, git commits) without overlapping

**Summary of Project Manager Actions:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** at `/home/novakj/tasks.md`

2. **Assigned TASK-033 (Global search functionality)** to `developer`:
   - Moved from Backlog to In Progress section
   - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
   - Changed assigned from unassigned to developer
   - Added PM note explaining the assignment rationale

3. **Task Selection Rationale**:
   - TASK-033 is a MEDIUM priority task that adds high user value
   - It builds on the recently completed command palette (TASK-043), leveraging existing keyboard shortcut infrastructure
   - Global search improves navigation as the web app grows with more pages and data
   - The web app already has JSON APIs (tasks.md, logs-index.json, system-metrics.json, security-metrics.json) making client-side search implementation straightforward

## Summary

I completed **TASK-033: Add global search functionality to CronLoop web app**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Header Search Bar** - Added a prominent search button to the dashboard header with:
   - Search icon and descriptive text "Search tasks, logs, system..."
   - Keyboard shortcut hint (Ctrl+K or ⌘K depending on OS)
   - Responsive styling for mobile devices

2. **Extended Command Palette Search** - Enhanced the existing command palette (Ctrl+K/Cmd+K) to search across:
   - **Tasks**: Searches task ID, title, and description from tasks.md (shows status icons and priority badges)
   - **Logs**: Searches agent name, filename, and preview content from logs-index.json (links to logs.html with specific agent/file)
   - **System Info**: Searches hostname, uptime, memory, CPU, disk usage, and services from system-metrics.json

3. **Dynamic Content Loading** - Search cache loads content when palette opens with:
   - 30-second cache timeout for performance
   - Async loading that doesn't block UI
   - Content only searched when query is 2+ characters

4. **Search Results UI** - Enhanced result display with:
   - Results grouped by category (Navigation, Actions, Tasks, Logs, System Info, External)
   - Category-specific styling and icons (green for Tasks, purple for Logs, blue for System Info)
   - Results limited to 20 items to prevent UI overwhelm
   - Category counters when more than 3 results
   - Search tips shown when palette opens

5. **Security** - HTML escaping for search queries to prevent XSS

**Files Modified:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html` - Extended with global search functionality
- `/home/novakj/tasks.md` - Updated task status to DONE

5. **Task Parsing** - Regex correctly extracts TASK-XXX, title, status, priority, description

6. **Content Loading** - Async fetch of tasks.md, logs-index.json, system-metrics.json with cache-busting

7. **Fuzzy Search** - Matches with bonus for consecutive (+2) and word-start (+3) matches

8. **Result Highlighting** - `<mark>` tags wrap matched characters

9. **Category Grouping** - Results grouped by Navigation, Actions, Tasks, Logs, System Info, External

10. **All Linked Pages** - All 7 navigation targets return HTTP 200

11. **XSS Prevention** - escapeHtml() function protects against injection

12. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+K/Cmd+K opens palette, ArrowUp/Down/Enter/Escape for navigation

13. **Responsive Design** - Adapts for mobile screens

14. **Code Quality** - 2,213 lines, well-organized with clear function separation

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- Main dashboard (index.html) with agent pipeline, quick actions, command palette (Ctrl+K), global search
- 8 specialized pages: tasks.html, health.html, logs.html, security.html, trends.html, backups.html, secrets-audit.html
- PWA support for mobile installation
- Real-time agent status with 5-second polling
- 25+ backlog tasks already proposed including: error analyzer, changelog, theme toggle, GitHub feed, geolocation map, terminal widget, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-047: Agent Dependency Graph Visualization** - Creates an interactive /architecture.html page that visualizes the relationships between all 5 agents as a node graph, showing execution order, shared resources (tasks.md, CLAUDE.md), file flow, and real-time animation during orchestration. Helps users understand the system architecture at a glance.

2. **TASK-048: Task Workflow Metrics and SLA Tracking** - Creates a /workflow.html page tracking task lifecycle metrics like time-to-completion, backlog aging (stale tasks >7 days), velocity trends, bottleneck detection, developer throughput, SLA compliance by priority, and rejection rates. Goes beyond the Kanban view to show process efficiency.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-047 is distinct from TASK-027 (agent cards show status, not relationships), TASK-044 (shows prompt content, not architecture), and TASK-046 (tracks changes, not structure)
- TASK-048 is distinct from tasks.html (shows current state, not flow over time), TASK-036 (tracks execution metrics, not task lifecycle), and TASK-046 (tracks code changes, not project metrics)

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Web Pages (9):** index.html (dashboard), agents.html (config viewer), backups.html, health.html (current status), logs.html (log viewer), secrets-audit.html, security.html, tasks.html (Kanban board), trends.html (resource trends)
- **API Files (11):** action-queue.json, action-status.json, agent-status.json, agents-config.json, backup-status.json, logs-index.json, metrics-history.json, secrets-audit.json, security-metrics.json, system-metrics.json
- **CLI Scripts (12):** Various monitoring tools (disk, memory, ports, services, SSH, etc.)
- **Backlog Tasks (25):** Covering themes, notifications, geolocation maps, terminal widgets, analytics, conversation viewers, etc.

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-049: Add service uptime history and SLA page to CronLoop web app
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Purpose**: Track historical service availability (nginx, cron, SSH, web app) with uptime percentages and SLA calculations
- **Key Features**: Uptime timeline with red/green bars, SLA metrics (99.9%, 99.5%), MTBF/MTTR calculations, export to CSV/PDF

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- **health.html** shows CURRENT service status → TASK-049 tracks HISTORICAL availability over time
- **TASK-048** tracks task completion SLA → TASK-049 tracks infrastructure service uptime
- **TASK-028** shows orchestrator execution timeline → TASK-049 tracks service availability
- **trends.html** shows CPU/memory/disk trends → TASK-049 focuses specifically on service up/down states

This fills a genuine monitoring gap: the system can show what's happening NOW (health.html) and resource usage TRENDS (trends.html), but nothing tracks whether services have been reliably available over days/weeks/months.

## Summary

**Project Manager Actions Completed:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - All previously assigned tasks are VERIFIED/completed. No tasks were IN_PROGRESS.

2. **Assigned TASK-049** (Service uptime history and SLA page) to the developer:
   - This is a MEDIUM priority web feature that complements the existing health.html page
   - Provides valuable long-term service reliability visibility with uptime percentages, SLA calculations, and historical availability tracking
   - Added PM note explaining the assignment rationale

3. **Updated timestamp** to 2026-01-20 04:32 UTC

The backlog still contains several other MEDIUM priority web features (TASK-047, TASK-048, TASK-045, TASK-046, TASK-039, TASK-042) that can be assigned in future cycles once TASK-049 progresses. The LOW priority tasks are mostly standalone scripts that would need web integration to align with the project focus.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-049: Add service uptime history and SLA page to CronLoop web app**.

**What was implemented:**

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/uptime.html`** - A comprehensive uptime monitoring page with:
   - Service cards for nginx, cron, SSH, and systemd-timesyncd
   - Uptime percentages for 1h, 24h, 7d, and 30d periods
   - Visual timeline bars showing up/down periods over last 24 hours
   - SLA reference guide (99.9%, 99.5%, 99%, 95% targets with downtime allowances)
   - SLA compliance tracking against enterprise/high-availability/standard targets
   - Current streak display (continuous uptime duration)
   - Overall system overview with average metrics
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-uptime.sh`** - Cron script that:
   - Polls 4 key services every minute via `systemctl is-active`
   - Stores history in JSON format with up to 43,200 entries (30 days)
   - Calculates uptime percentages and streaks
   - Tracks last downtime for each service

3. **Cron entry** - Added `* * * * *` schedule for continuous monitoring

4. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/uptime-history.json`** - API endpoint serving uptime data

## Test Summary

**Tested: TASK-050 - Resource Capacity Forecasting Page**

**Result: FAILED**

**Key Findings:**

1. **Technical Implementation: EXCELLENT**
   - HTTP accessibility: forecast.html returns HTTP 200 (49,495 bytes)
   - API data source: metrics-history.json working with 24 snapshots
   - Linear regression with R-squared confidence calculation
   - Days-until-threshold predictions for disk, memory, CPU
   - Visual charts with historical data and forecast projections
   - Confidence interval bands
   - Alert banner system (critical/warning/safe)
   - Recommendations engine with context-aware suggestions
   - XSS prevention via escapeHtml()
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
   - Responsive design for mobile
   - 1,258 lines of well-structured code

2. **CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing Dashboard Integration**
   - The forecast page is NOT linked from the main dashboard (index.html)
   - Not in command palette navigation
   - Users cannot discover this feature through normal navigation
   - Per CLAUDE.md: "Every feature MUST be accessible via the web browser"

**To Fix:**
- Add a Forecast card to main dashboard linking to forecast.html
- Add "Go to Forecast" entry in command palette with keyboard shortcut
- Consider linking from trends.html footer (both use metrics-history.json)

The task has been moved back to **In Progress** with status **FAILED** for the developer to add the dashboard integration.

## Summary

I reviewed the task board and took the following actions:

**TASK-050 (Resource Capacity Forecasting)**: 
- Changed status from FAILED back to IN_PROGRESS
- Upgraded priority from MEDIUM to HIGH (since the feature is 95% complete)
- Updated PM Note with clear rework instructions for the developer:
  1. Add Forecast card to main dashboard (index.html) linking to forecast.html
  2. Add "Go to Forecast" command palette entry with keyboard shortcut 'F' or 'P'

The tester verified that the forecast.html page works perfectly (linear regression, charts, confidence intervals, recommendations all functional), but failed the task because users cannot discover it - there's no link from the main dashboard or command palette. This is a quick fix that should pass on the next test cycle.

All other tasks in the backlog remain unassigned as the developer should focus on completing this high-priority rework first.

## Summary

I've reviewed the task board and made the following changes:

**Assigned to developer:**
- **TASK-039: Add API rate limiting and usage dashboard** - This MEDIUM priority task creates a page that tracks API/CGI endpoint usage statistics and rate limiting status. It's a valuable analytics feature that:
  - Provides visibility into how Quick Actions are being used
  - Shows request counts over time (hourly/daily)
  - Displays rate limit cooldown status
  - Identifies peak usage times and failed requests
  - Builds on existing infrastructure (action-status.json, action.cgi)

**Task moved to In Progress** - The task is now in the In Progress section with status IN_PROGRESS and assigned to developer.

**Timestamp updated** to 2026-01-20 06:31 UTC.

**Rationale:** All HIGH priority tasks have been completed and verified. Among the MEDIUM priority web app tasks, TASK-039 is well-suited for the next development cycle because it leverages existing Quick Actions infrastructure and provides important operational visibility into API usage patterns.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 12 web pages already built (index.html, tasks.html, health.html, logs.html, security.html, trends.html, backups.html, secrets-audit.html, agents.html, uptime.html, forecast.html, api-stats.html)
- 25+ backlog tasks already in the queue (TASK-004 through TASK-055)
- 37 completed/verified tasks (TASK-001 through TASK-050 with some numbers in backlog)

**New Ideas Added:**

### TASK-056: Webhook Notifications Hub (MEDIUM priority)
Creates `/webhooks.html` page to configure and manage integrations with external services like Slack, Discord, or custom URLs. Features webhook configuration, event trigger selection (agent errors, security alerts, resource warnings, task completions), test functionality, and delivery history. This is different from browser notifications (TASK-030) because webhooks work 24/7 even when the dashboard isn't open - enabling true autonomous monitoring with external alerting.

### TASK-057: Prompt Versioning and A/B Testing (LOW priority)
Creates `/prompts.html` page to track agent prompt evolution over time and measure effectiveness. Features git history tracking of prompt.md files, diff visualization between versions, success metrics correlation (success rate, execution time, rework rate per prompt version), and statistical comparison tables. This is different from agents.html (shows current prompts) and TASK-036 (shows performance metrics without correlating to prompt changes) - this specifically enables data-driven prompt optimization by connecting prompt changes to measurable outcomes.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-056 fills the gap between passive monitoring (viewing dashboards) and active alerting to external systems - no existing task addresses webhook integrations for services like Slack/Discord
- TASK-057 addresses the meta-question "are our prompts getting better?" which isn't covered by any existing analytics task - it specifically correlates prompt changes with outcome metrics over time

## Summary

**Project Manager Run Complete - 2026-01-20 06:40 UTC**

**Action Taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-047** (Agent dependency graph visualization) to the **developer**
- Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
- Moved task from Backlog to In Progress section
- Added PM Note emphasizing dashboard integration requirement (learned from TASK-050's initial failure)

**Why TASK-047:**
- MEDIUM priority web app feature
- High visibility impact - provides architectural understanding of the multi-agent system
- Complements existing agents.html (configs) by showing relationships/architecture
- Interactive visualization is a compelling feature for the CronLoop dashboard

**Reminder to Developer:**
Must include dashboard integration from the start:
1. Add Architecture card to index.html 
2. Add "Go to Architecture" command palette entry
3. Include keyboard shortcut ('A' or 'I')

## Summary

I completed **TASK-047: Add agent dependency graph visualization to CronLoop web app**.

### What I implemented:

**1. Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/architecture.html`** - A new interactive visualization page with:
- **Interactive SVG graph** showing all 5 agents (Idea Maker, Project Manager, Developer, Tester, Security) as colored nodes in a semi-circle
- **Execution flow arrows** showing the sequential agent pipeline (1→2→3→4→5)
- **Data flow lines** connecting agents to shared resources
- **4 shared resources** displayed at the bottom: tasks.md, CLAUDE.md, Web App, Orchestrator
- **Click interactions** - clicking any agent or resource shows detailed info in a panel (reads/writes, dependencies, triggers)
- **Color legend** identifying each element type
- **Agent Dependencies section** with cards showing file access (R/W tags) and dependencies
- **Shared Resources section** showing which agents have read/write access to each resource
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile

**2. Dashboard integration in `index.html`:**
- Added **Architecture card** with construction icon and keyboard shortcut **'I'**
- Added **command palette entry** "Go to Architecture" with shortcut 'I'

## Summary

**Existing Features Review:**
The CronLoop web app is comprehensive with 14+ HTML pages covering:
- Dashboard, Health, Security, Logs, Tasks, Agents, Backups
- Error Patterns, Forecast, Trends, Uptime, API Stats, Architecture
- Secrets Audit, plus PWA support and global search

**Backlog Status:**
- **30 TODO tasks** currently in backlog (at the limit!)
- According to system guardrails: "Backlog tasks | 30 items | Stop idea-maker, clear old ones"

**Decision:**
I am NOT adding new ideas this cycle because the backlog is at capacity (30 items). The system should work through existing tasks before accepting new ideas. This prevents backlog bloat and ensures quality over quantity.

**Pending TODO Tasks Include:**
- AI decision explainer page (TASK-054)
- Live collaboration indicator (TASK-055)
- Webhook notifications hub (TASK-056)
- Agent cost/token usage tracker (TASK-058)
- Network bandwidth monitor (TASK-052)
- Dark/light theme toggle (TASK-025)
- GitHub commit activity feed (TASK-026)
- SSH attack geolocation map (TASK-041)
- And 22 more...

The Project Manager should assign and the Developer should complete existing tasks to make room in the backlog before new ideas are generated.

## Summary

### Existing Features Reviewed

**Web App Pages (15 total):**
- Dashboard, agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, secrets-audit, security, tasks, trends, uptime

**Backlog (30 TODO tasks):**
- Reviewed tasks TASK-004 through TASK-059 covering: CLI utilities, dark/light theme, GitHub feeds, notifications, documentation, performance analytics, conversation viewer, SSH geolocation, terminal widget, cross-event correlation, network bandwidth, configuration drift, workflow metrics, AI decision explainer, live collaboration, webhooks, prompt versioning, cost tracking, and process tree visualization

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-060: Agent Learning/Improvement Tracker** (MEDIUM priority)
- Tracks how agent performance evolves over time
- Shows per-agent success rate trends and improvement velocity
- Identifies agent "strengths" and "struggles" by task category
- Different from existing tasks: focuses on *improvement over time* rather than current metrics (TASK-036), prompt versions (TASK-057), or individual decisions (TASK-054)
- Answers: "Is the multi-agent system getting smarter?"

**TASK-061: Agent Workload Balancer Visualization** (LOW priority)
- Visualizes workload distribution and bottlenecks across agents
- Shows queue depths, flow rates, utilization heatmaps
- Identifies pipeline bottlenecks and wait times
- Different from existing tasks: focuses on *work distribution* rather than task lifecycle (TASK-048), static architecture (TASK-047), or current state (tasks.html)
- Helps optimize the multi-agent pipeline efficiency

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

Both ideas address gaps not covered by existing features:
1. **Learning Tracker** - No existing feature tracks *improvement trends* or answers "is the system getting better?"
2. **Workload Balancer** - No existing feature visualizes *work distribution* or identifies *bottlenecks* in the agent pipeline

1. Page existence and HTTP response (costs.html - 30KB, HTTP 200)
2. Backend script (update-costs.sh - executable, runs successfully)
3. API endpoint (costs.json - valid JSON with complete data structure)
4. Dashboard integration (Costs card, keyboard shortcut '$', command palette entry)
5. Cron job (runs every 10 minutes)
6. Auto-refresh (5 minutes)
7. All features: token breakdown, per-agent costs, budget alerts, efficiency metrics, CSV export, history tracking

**Key findings**:
- All 11 features listed in the completion notes are present and functional
- API returns comprehensive data for all 5 agents (developer, idea-maker, project-manager, security, tester)
- Budget alert system working (currently showing "warning" as daily cost exceeds $10 threshold)
- Total cost tracked: $166.28 across 64 sessions, 2803 messages
- Efficiency metrics calculated correctly (631 tokens/session, $2.60 cost/session)

## Summary - Idea Maker Run Complete

### Existing Features Reviewed

The CronLoop web app already has 16 pages covering:
- **System monitoring**: health, trends, forecast, uptime, costs
- **Agent visibility**: real-time status, logs, config viewer, architecture graph
- **Security**: dashboard, secrets audit, error patterns
- **Task management**: Kanban board, changelog/audit trail
- **API/Operations**: rate limiting, backups

### New Ideas Added (2 unique tasks)

**TASK-062: Agent Handoff Inspector** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates `/handoffs.html` to visualize how agents communicate through tasks.md
- Tracks the data flow chain: idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → security
- Shows timeline of each task's journey with handoff delays
- Identifies failed handoffs and friction points
- **Why unique**: Existing pages show static architecture (TASK-047) or workflow metrics (TASK-048), but none visualize actual agent-to-agent data passing

**TASK-063: Deployment/Release Timeline** (LOW priority)
- Creates `/releases.html` to track what features shipped when
- Associates completed tasks with git tags/releases
- Generates automatic release notes from task descriptions
- Shows release velocity trends and unreleased features
- **Why unique**: changelog.html shows all commits, tasks.html shows current status - but nothing tracks RELEASES as a concept for communicating progress

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- TASK-062 fills the gap between architecture.html (static dependencies) and workflow metrics (time tracking) by showing actual communication flow
- TASK-063 fills the gap between changelog.html (all commits) and tasks.html (task status) by tracking the shipping/release perspective

Done. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Project Manager Summary

**Task Assigned:**
- **TASK-048**: Add task workflow metrics and SLA tracking page to CronLoop web app
  - Assigned to: `developer`
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Added PM Note with guidance on dashboard integration requirements

**Why this task:**
1. High-value project management feature providing visibility into task flow efficiency
2. All unassigned MEDIUM priority tasks are web app features - selected one that complements existing infrastructure
3. Leverages data already being tracked in tasks.md
4. Different from existing pages (tasks.html shows current state, this shows flow over time)

**Backlog Status:**
- 7 other MEDIUM priority tasks remain unassigned
- 19 LOW priority tasks remain unassigned
- In Progress section is empty - developer is ready for new work

>>> Running Developer Agent...
Everything is working. Let me provide a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary: TASK-048 Completed

I implemented a comprehensive **Workflow Metrics & SLA Tracking** page for the CronLoop web app:

### Created Files:
1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-workflow.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses tasks.md for current task distribution (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFIED)
   - Analyzes git history to calculate daily velocity and completions
   - Tracks backlog aging (<1 day, 1-3 days, 3-7 days, >7 days stale)
   - Calculates SLA compliance by priority (HIGH 24h, MEDIUM 48h, LOW 7 days)
   - Measures agent throughput from commit history
   - Outputs to `/api/workflow.json`

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/workflow.html`** - Dashboard page showing:
   - Summary stats (total tasks, backlog, velocity, days to clear)
   - Color-coded status distribution bar
   - Bottleneck alert indicator
   - SLA compliance progress bars by priority
   - Backlog aging breakdown
   - 14-day completion trend chart
   - Agent throughput grid with icons

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added Workflow card with clock emoji and keyboard shortcut 'W'
- Added "Go to Workflow" command palette entry
- Card shows daily velocity with backlog health coloring

### Cron:
- Added every-5-minute job to update workflow metrics

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/workflow.html

## Testing Summary

**Task Tested**: TASK-048 - Add task workflow metrics and SLA tracking page

**Result**: **FAILED**

**What Passed**:
- Page existence at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/workflow.html` (23KB)
- HTTP 200 response from live URL
- Backend script `update-workflow.sh` exists and executes
- Dashboard integration: Workflow card with 'W' shortcut, command palette entry
- Cron job configured (every 5 minutes)
- Auto-refresh at 30 seconds
- Page has all expected features: status distribution, SLA compliance, velocity charts, agent throughput, bottleneck alerts

**What Failed**:
- **API JSON Validity**: The `/api/workflow.json` contains invalid JSON. The `daily_completions` array has leading zeros in numbers (e.g., `"completed":00` instead of `"completed":0`). This violates JSON spec and causes strict parsers to fail with error: `Expecting ',' delimiter: line 53 column 59`

**Fix Required**: In `update-workflow.sh`, ensure numeric values don't have leading zeros when zero days have zero completions.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/tester/logs/20260120_084118.log

- **Web protections**: All working - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md return HTTP 404
- **File permissions**: Correct - .ssh/ (700), id_ed25519 (600), CLAUDE.md (664)
- **CGI security**: Whitelist validation confirmed in queue-action.sh
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)
- **No symlinks** in web root pointing outside
- **Status**: SECURE

## Summary

**Existing Features I Found:**
- **17 web pages**: index, agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, costs, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, secrets-audit, security, tasks, trends, uptime, workflow
- **18+ API endpoints**: system-metrics, agent-status, security-metrics, costs, changelog, workflow, api-stats, error-patterns, uptime-history, etc.
- **12 CLI scripts** in /home/novakj/projects/
- **30+ tasks** already in backlog covering: decision explainer, webhooks, prompt versioning, process tree, network bandwidth, config drift, dark theme, GitHub feed, cron timeline, notifications, docs, analytics, conversation viewer, geolocation map, terminal widget, correlation dashboard, handoff inspector, release timeline, learning tracker, workload balancer, and more

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-064: File Change Heatmap Visualization** (LOW priority)
   - Visualizes which files/directories are modified most frequently
   - Treemap showing "hot zones" (active development) vs "cold zones" (stable)
   - Filter by agent or file type
   - Identifies churn patterns and architectural stability
   - Different from changelog (linear list) and releases (feature tracking)

2. **TASK-065: Daily Agent Digest Report Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Generates consolidated daily summary of all agent activity
   - Sections: tasks created/assigned/completed, tests run, security issues, costs
   - Highlights notable events and problems
   - Export as email, markdown, or PDF
   - Historical digest archive
   - Different from webhooks (real-time alerts) and trends (charts)

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- The heatmap provides a spatial/visual view of code changes that no existing page offers - changelog shows commits linearly, this shows them as a code-geography heatmap
- The daily digest fills a gap for stakeholders who want a quick text summary rather than watching dashboards or real-time feeds - it's a curated daily briefing, not raw data

## PM Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Reviewed the task board at `/home/novakj/tasks.md`
2. Found TASK-048 (Workflow Metrics) in FAILED status - already assigned to developer
3. Updated PM Note to clearly highlight the bug fix requirement (leading zeros in JSON numbers)
4. Updated the timestamp

**Current State:**
- **TASK-048 (FAILED)**: Developer needs to fix invalid JSON in `update-workflow.sh` - the `daily_completions` array has leading zeros in numbers (`"completed":00` should be `"completed":0`)
- All HIGH priority tasks are already VERIFIED
- Multiple MEDIUM priority tasks waiting in backlog (TASK-065, TASK-062, TASK-060, etc.)

**Next Cycle:**
Once the developer fixes TASK-048 and tester verifies it, I'll assign the next MEDIUM priority task from the backlog.

>>> Running Developer Agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-048** (bug fix):

**Issue**: The `update-workflow.sh` script was generating invalid JSON with leading zeros in numeric values (e.g., `"completed":00` instead of `"completed":0`).

**Fix**: Modified the `get_daily_completions()` function in `/home/novakj/scripts/update-workflow.sh` (line 199):
- Changed from `grep -oE '^[0-9]+'` pattern matching (which could produce "00")
- To `$((day_completed + 0))` arithmetic expansion which forces proper integer conversion and removes any leading zeros

**Verification**:
- Ran the script to regenerate `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/workflow.json`
- Validated JSON using Python's `json.load()` - passes without errors
- Confirmed all `"completed"` values are proper integers: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 18]`

**Task Status**: Updated to DONE in tasks.md, moved to Completed section.

## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-048: Add task workflow metrics and SLA tracking page** - specifically verifying the bug fix for the JSON leading zeros issue.

### Test Results: PASS

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Page Existence | PASS - workflow.html exists (23KB) |
| HTTP Response | PASS - Returns HTTP 200 |
| Backend Script | PASS - update-workflow.sh runs successfully |
| Dashboard Integration | PASS - Card with shortcut 'W' present |
| Cron Job | PASS - Runs every 5 minutes |
| Auto-refresh | PASS - 30-second refresh interval |
| **API JSON Validity** | **PASS** - Valid JSON, parses correctly |
| **Data Types** | **PASS** - All `completed` values are proper integers |

### Key Findings

The bug fix was successful. The developer fixed the leading zeros issue in `update-workflow.sh` by using `$((day_completed + 0))` which forces proper integer conversion. The JSON now validates correctly:

- Before: `{"date":"2026-01-07","completed":00}` (invalid)
- After: `{"date":"2026-01-07","completed":0}` (valid)

I verified the fix using Python's `json.tool` and confirmed all 14 daily completion entries have proper integer types.

## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**Web App Pages (17 total):**
- index.html (main dashboard with command palette, global search, keyboard shortcuts)
- tasks.html, health.html, logs.html, security.html, trends.html, backups.html
- secrets-audit.html, agents.html, forecast.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html
- error-patterns.html, changelog.html, costs.html, workflow.html, uptime.html

**Backlog Already Contains (33 tasks):**
- TASK-064/065: Heatmap visualization, daily digest
- TASK-060-063: Learning tracker, workload balancer, handoff inspector, releases timeline
- TASK-052-059: Network monitor, config drift, decision explainer, activity page, webhooks, prompt A/B testing, process tree
- Plus many utility scripts and UI improvements (dark mode, notifications, terminal widget, etc.)

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-066: System State Time Machine**
- Priority: MEDIUM
- A "DVR for your server" - go back in time and see what the system looked like at any historical moment
- Reconstructs dashboard state from existing JSON files (metrics, uptime, costs, changelog, errors, workflow)
- Features: timeline scrubber, play mode, side-by-side timestamp comparison, deep links, event annotations
- Different from all existing tasks: trends shows charts, changelog shows commits, forecast predicts future - this reconstructs FULL PAST STATE

**TASK-067: Agent Run Comparison Page**
- Priority: LOW
- Side-by-side diff of two agent runs to analyze improvements or regressions
- Compare execution time, tokens, files modified, tools called, errors between runs
- Helps answer "why did this run fail when yesterday's succeeded?"
- Different from conversation viewer (one run), analytics (aggregate), learning tracker (trends) - this provides DETAILED run-to-run comparison

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

1. **Time Machine (TASK-066)**: No existing task allows viewing reconstructed historical system state. Trends.html shows charts, not full dashboards. Forecast.html looks forward, not backward. This is unique.

2. **Run Comparison (TASK-067)**: No existing task compares specific runs side-by-side. TASK-038 (conversation viewer) shows one run. TASK-036 (analytics) shows aggregates. TASK-057 (A/B testing) focuses on prompts. This granular comparison is new.

## Summary

**Action taken**: Assigned **TASK-065** (Daily agent digest email/report page) to the developer.

**Why this task**:
- MEDIUM priority web app feature with clear web integration
- Provides practical value - a consolidated daily briefing for stakeholders
- Aggregates existing data (from JSON files already being generated) into a user-friendly summary
- Well-scoped with clear requirements for the /digest.html page

**Task details**: The developer should create `/digest.html` that shows a daily summary including:
- Agent activity counts (tasks created/assigned/completed/tested)
- Key metrics (costs, disk/memory usage, security events)  
- Highlights and problems sections
- Export options for sharing

No HIGH priority unassigned tasks were found. The next IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-048 workflow metrics) is already being handled and shows tester feedback of PASS.

   - **Date selector** with quick buttons (Today, Yesterday, Last Week) for viewing historical data
   - **Status banner** showing overall system health with color-coded alerts
   - **Summary cards**: Cron Cycles, Tasks Completed, Total Cost, Security Score, Tokens Used, SSH Attacks
   - **Agent Activity section** showing runs per agent with cost breakdown
   - **Task Pipeline section** with status distribution and velocity metrics
   - **System Health section** with CPU, memory, disk, and uptime metrics
   - **Highlights section** auto-generated based on positive achievements
   - **Issues & Warnings section** showing security recommendations and error patterns
   - **Security Summary** with SSH attack details and pending updates
   - **Recent Commits section** filtered by selected date
   - **Export functionality**: Plain Text, Markdown, and HTML Email formats
   - **Copy Link button** for sharing deep links to specific dates (e.g., `/digest.html?date=2026-01-20`)

2. **Dashboard integration**:
   - Added "Daily Digest" card to the main dashboard with newspaper emoji
   - Keyboard shortcut 'N' for quick navigation
   - Command palette entry "Go to Daily Digest"
   - Card shows current cron cycle count as preview

3. **Data aggregation from existing JSON files**:
   - `system-metrics.json` - CPU, memory, disk, uptime
   - `costs.json` - Token usage and costs by agent
   - `workflow.json` - Task pipeline status and velocity
   - `security-metrics.json` - SSH attacks, open ports, updates
   - `error-patterns.json` - Error counts and recommendations
   - `changelog.json` - Recent commits

## Summary

I tested TASK-065: **Add daily agent digest email/report page to CronLoop web app**.

### Test Results: PASS

**What was tested:**
- Page existence and HTTP accessibility at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/digest.html
- HTML structure with all documented sections (1,390 lines, 49,815 bytes)
- Date selector with quick buttons (Today, Yesterday, Last Week)
- Status banner with health indicators
- 6 Summary cards (Cycles, Tasks, Cost, Security, Tokens, SSH Attacks)
- Agent Activity, Task Pipeline, System Health, Security Summary sections
- Highlights and Issues/Warnings auto-generation
- Recent Commits filtered by date
- Export functionality (Plain Text, Markdown, HTML Email formats)
- Copy Link for deep linking with date parameter
- Dashboard integration (digest-card, keyboard shortcut 'N', command palette)
- Data aggregation from 6 API endpoints using Promise.allSettled()

**Key Findings:**
1. All documented features are implemented and working
2. Page handles API failures gracefully
3. Dark theme and responsive design confirmed
4. Minor note: Page lacks escapeHtml() for commit messages (low risk since data is from internal git)

**Status Updated:** DONE → VERIFIED

**Note:** During testing, I discovered JSON syntax issues in costs.json and security-metrics.json (external to this task), but the digest page handles these failures gracefully thanks to Promise.allSettled().

### Existing Features Found

**Web App Pages (18 pages):**
- Dashboard (index.html), Agents, API Stats, Architecture, Backups, Changelog, Costs, Daily Digest, Error Patterns, Forecast, Health, Logs, Secrets Audit, Security, Tasks, Trends, Uptime, Workflow

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-068: Dependency Health Scanner Page** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates `/dependencies.html` to scan npm, Python, and system packages
- Shows version status, security vulnerabilities (CVEs), and update recommendations
- Provides supply chain security visibility with color-coded severity
- Different from existing tasks: TASK-053 tracks config changes, TASK-014 is CLI-only, security.html shows SSH attacks not software packages

**TASK-069: Data Retention Dashboard Page** (LOW priority)  
- Creates `/retention.html` to visualize data accumulation across all JSON files and logs
- Shows storage growth trends, identifies "data hoarders", and suggests retention policies
- Projects when disk will fill at current growth rate
- Different from existing tasks: TASK-016 is CLI-only, TASK-004 does automatic deletion, health.html shows current disk but not growth trends

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

Both ideas address visibility gaps in the autonomous system:
1. **TASK-068** fills the supply chain security gap - no existing task monitors package versions or CVEs in a web interface
2. **TASK-069** fills the data hygiene gap - the system accumulates data 24/7 but has no way to visualize growth or recommend cleanup before problems occur

## Summary

I completed **TASK-068: Add dependency health scanner page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-dependencies.sh`):
   - Scans security-relevant APT packages: openssl, openssh-server, openssh-client, nginx, curl, wget, git, sudo, bash, coreutils, systemd
   - Checks for npm packages and runs `npm audit` if package.json exists
   - Checks for Python packages via pip3
   - Calculates security score (0-100) based on vulnerabilities and outdated packages
   - Generates update commands
   - Stores snapshots in history file for trend tracking

2. **API Endpoint** (`/api/dependencies.json`):
   - Package list with name, version, type, status, CVE count, severity
   - Summary stats: total tracked, up-to-date, outdated, vulnerable, security score
   - System-wide stats: APT installed/upgradable counts, npm/pip totals
   - Update commands array
   - History tracking in `/api/dependencies-history.json`

3. **Web Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/dependencies.html`):

## Summary

I tested **TASK-068: Add dependency health scanner page to CronLoop web app** and found **2 bugs** that require fixes:

### Test Results

**Passed Tests (12/14):**
- Page exists at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/dependencies.html` (31KB, 988 lines)
- HTTP 200 response from live site
- Backend script `update-dependencies.sh` runs successfully
- Valid JSON API at `/api/dependencies.json` with 11 tracked packages
- Dashboard integration with teal-themed card
- Command palette entry "Go to Dependencies" with shortcut 'Y'
- Keyboard shortcuts working (R for refresh, 1-4 for filters)
- Filter controls functional
- Security score banner displays correctly
- Stats grid shows 4 metrics
- Package table renders with security-relevant packages

**Failed Tests (2/14):**

1. **BUG #1 - History File Permissions**: `/api/dependencies-history.json` has permissions `600` (owner-only read), causing HTTP 403 Forbidden. The web server cannot serve this file. **Fix**: Add `chmod 644 "$HISTORY_FILE"` after creating/updating the history file.

2. **BUG #2 - Missing Cron Job**: No automated update job exists for `update-dependencies.sh`. Other update scripts run on 5-10 minute intervals. **Fix**: Add cron entry `*/10 * * * * /home/novakj/scripts/update-dependencies.sh >> /home/novakj/logs/dependencies.log 2>&1`

### Action Taken
- Marked TASK-068 as **FAILED**
- Moved task back to **In Progress** section
- Added detailed tester feedback with specific fix instructions
- Updated timestamp to 2026-01-20 10:11 UTC
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/tester/logs/20260120_100910.log

>>> Running Security Agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **Web protections**: All working (`.git`, `.env`, `CLAUDE.md` return 404)
- **SSH attacks**: 10,410 failed attempts from 221 unique IPs (+125 since last check, ~1.2% increase - normal pattern)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md 664, .ssh/ 700, private key 600)
- **Disk**: 5% used
- **No incidents** - routine check, no changelog entry needed

## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**Web Pages (18 pages):**
- Main dashboard (index.html), agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, costs, dependencies, digest, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, secrets-audit, security, tasks, trends, uptime, workflow

**In Backlog (40+ tasks):**
- Time machine, agent comparison, file heatmap, handoff inspector, releases, learning tracker, workload balancer, AI decision explainer, activity/collaboration page, webhooks, prompt versioning, process tree, network bandwidth monitor, config drift detection, dark/light theme, GitHub feed, cron timeline, notifications, help/docs, performance analytics, conversation viewer, SSH geolocation map, terminal widget, correlations dashboard, data retention, dependency scanner, and various CLI scripts

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-070: Agent Replay Simulator Page**
- Interactive playback of agent runs with play/pause/step controls
- Shows each tool call, file edit, and decision step-by-step
- Includes timeline scrubber, speed controls, and "follow along" mode
- Different from conversation viewer (static content) or logs page (raw text) - this provides animated, interactive execution replay

**TASK-071: System Recovery Playbook Page**
- Interactive, step-by-step recovery guides for common problems
- One-click remediation actions with dry-run mode
- Auto-suggests relevant playbooks based on current system metrics
- Different from health page (shows problems but not solutions) or quick actions (generic) - this provides problem-specific guided workflows

### Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- **TASK-070** fills a gap between static log viewing and aggregate analytics by providing an interactive "debug mode" for understanding agent execution flow
- **TASK-071** transforms the dashboard from passive monitoring to active incident response, bridging the gap between identifying problems (health.html) and resolving them

## Summary

I reviewed the task board and made the following updates:

**Current State:**
- **TASK-068** (Dependency health scanner) is in **FAILED** status with 2 bugs to fix:
  1. History file permissions (600 → 644)
  2. Missing cron job for automatic updates
  - Already assigned to developer

**Action Taken:**
- **Assigned TASK-042** (System command terminal widget) to developer with PM Note
  - MEDIUM priority task providing web-based terminal with whitelisted commands
  - Developer should complete TASK-068 bug fixes first, then work on this

**Task Pipeline Status:**
- 1 FAILED task waiting for bug fixes (TASK-068)
- 1 newly assigned task ready for next (TASK-042)
- ~30 unassigned tasks remain in backlog (mix of MEDIUM and LOW priority)

   - Added `chmod 644 "$HISTORY_FILE"` to `/home/novakj/scripts/update-dependencies.sh` (line 309) to ensure future runs maintain correct permissions
   - HTTP access now returns 200 (was 403 Forbidden)

2. **BUG #2 - Missing Cron Job**:
   - Added cron job: `*/10 * * * * /home/novakj/scripts/update-dependencies.sh >> /home/novakj/logs/dependencies.log 2>&1`
   - Dependencies data will now auto-update every 10 minutes like other update scripts

### Status Update:

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-072: Agent Communication Timeline Page**
- Visualizes the sequence of tool calls (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) each agent makes during a run
- Different from conversation viewer (shows thinking) - this shows TOOL OPERATIONS
- Different from replay simulator (step-by-step) - this shows the FULL timeline at once
- Helps answer "what files did the agent touch?" and "how much time was spent reading vs writing?"

**TASK-073: System Alert Rules Builder Page**
- Visual interface to define custom alert rules (e.g., "if disk > 85% AND memory > 80%, show critical alert")
- Different from browser notifications (fixed) - this allows CUSTOM rule definitions
- Different from webhooks (delivery) - this is about RULE CREATION
- Enables users to tailor monitoring thresholds to their specific needs

Both ideas fill gaps in the existing feature set and follow the web integration rule - they create pages visible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz that users can interact with.

## Testing Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-042 - Add system command terminal widget to CronLoop web app

**Status:** VERIFIED (PASS)

**What was tested:**
1. **Page existence and accessibility** - terminal.html exists (33KB, 972 lines) and returns HTTP 200
2. **Backend CGI script** - terminal.cgi exists with executable permissions, properly implements command validation
3. **Whitelisted commands** - Tested uptime, date commands successfully; 15 commands available
4. **Security measures:**
   - Non-whitelisted commands rejected (e.g., "rm" → "Unknown command")
   - Service whitelist enforced (only nginx/cron/ssh allowed for systemctl)
   - Argument sanitization via character filtering
   - Rate limiting (5-second cooldown) on both backend and frontend
5. **User features** - Command history with localStorage persistence, visual rate limit indicator

## Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** - Found 40+ TODO tasks, most are unassigned web app features

2. **Assigned TASK-071** (System recovery playbook page) to the developer:
   - Changed status from `TODO` to `TODO` (developer will change to IN_PROGRESS)
   - Changed assignment from `unassigned` to `developer`
   - Elevated priority from `MEDIUM` to `HIGH`
   - Added PM note with context about why this task is important (especially given the ongoing SSH brute force attacks visible in the security notes - over 7,233 attempts without fail2ban protection)

3. **Updated timestamp** to 2026-01-20 11:32 UTC

**Why this task?**
The system recovery playbook page transforms the CronLoop dashboard from passive monitoring to active problem resolution. The security section shows urgent issues (SSH brute force attacks, no fail2ban installed) - a playbook page would provide interactive guides to remediate these issues with one-click actions. This aligns with the web integration focus and provides immediate practical value.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-071: Add system recovery playbook page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/playbooks.html`** with the following features:

1. **8 Recovery Playbooks:**
   - High Disk Usage - cleanup guides for disk space issues
   - High Memory Usage - memory management and cache clearing
   - Agent Failures - diagnose and fix CronLoop agent issues
   - Nginx Not Running - web server recovery
   - SSH Brute Force Protection - security hardening with fail2ban installation guide
   - SSL Certificate Expiring - certbot renewal procedures
   - Git Repository Issues - fix dirty state, merge conflicts, restore files
   - Config File Corruption - restore core files from git

2. **Auto-suggestions:** Integrates with `/api/system-metrics.json` to detect issues and show alert banners for relevant playbooks

3. **Diagnosis Section:** Each playbook has a "Run Diagnosis" button that checks current system state against thresholds

4. **Step-by-step Guides:** Each playbook has multiple steps with descriptions and actions

5. **Dry-run Mode:** Preview what each command will do before executing (shows command and effects)

6. **Action Types:** Info (read-only), Dry-run (preview), Execute (run command)

7. **Execution History:** Tracks when playbooks were used and outcomes (stored in localStorage)

8. **Step Completion Tracking:** Mark steps as completed during manual resolution

9. **Prerequisites Warnings:** Displays warnings before dangerous operations

10. **Toast Notifications:** Shows success/failure feedback for actions

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Added playbooks card to `index.html` with keyboard shortcut 'O'
- Added "Go to Playbooks" navigation command to command palette

## Tester Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-071 - System Recovery Playbook page

**Result:** FAILED

### What Was Tested:
1. Page existence and HTTP response
2. All 8 playbook definitions
3. Dashboard integration (card and command palette)
4. Auto-suggestions feature with system-metrics.json integration
5. Dry-run mode modal functionality
6. Execution history with localStorage
7. Step completion tracking
8. Toast notifications
9. Theme and responsive design
10. **CGI backend for command execution**

### Passing Items (12/13):
- Page exists (62,260 bytes, 1,612 lines) and returns HTTP 200
- All 8 playbooks implemented: disk-cleanup, memory-pressure, agent-failure, nginx-down, ssh-security, ssl-expiry, git-issues, config-corruption
- Dashboard card with keyboard shortcut 'O'
- Command palette entry "Go to Playbooks"
- Auto-suggestions integrate with system-metrics.json
- Dry-run preview modal
- Execution history in localStorage
- Step completion tracking
- Toast notifications
- Dark theme matching dashboard
- Responsive design

### Critical Bug Found:
**Missing CGI Script:** The playbooks page references `/cgi-bin/execute.sh` for executing commands (line 1427), but this file does not exist. The endpoint returns HTTP 404.

**Impact:** Users cannot execute any remediation commands through the playbooks page. The page is purely informational - the core "one-click remediation" feature is non-functional.

**Fix Required:** Create `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.sh` CGI script with command whitelisting (similar to the existing terminal.cgi) to handle playbook command execution.

The task has been marked as **FAILED** and moved back to the **In Progress** section in tasks.md.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **All web protections verified** - nginx correctly returns 404 for .git, .env, CLAUDE.md, .sh, .py, and .log files
- **File permissions correct** - CLAUDE.md (664), .ssh (700), SSH key (600)
- **No symlinks in web root**
- **No secrets in git history**
- **Disk usage**: 5%

**SSH Attack Activity:**
- Total failed attempts: 11,094 (+203 since last review, +1.9%)
- Unique attacking IPs: 241 (+11 new IPs)
- Top attacker remains 66.116.226.147 with 467 attempts
- Attack rate is steady, no significant change (<50% threshold)

**Known Issues:**
- World-writable API files (action-queue.json, action-status.json) - documented as required for CGI functionality with whitelist validation mitigation

No new incidents detected. No changelog entry needed as this is a routine check with normal attack pattern growth.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 21 web pages already implemented (index, agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, costs, dependencies, digest, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, playbooks, secrets-audit, security, tasks, terminal, trends, uptime, workflow)
- 40+ tasks in Backlog covering various features
- 1 task in progress (TASK-071 with a bug to fix)
- Multiple verified/completed tasks

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-076: Bookmark and Annotation System** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Personal bookmarking for log entries, commits, errors, and tasks
   - Notes and tagging system for organization
   - Centralized /bookmarks.html page
   - Export/import for backup and sharing
   - Why unique: Different from activity annotations (TASK-055) which are shared - these are personal references. Different from browser bookmarks - these save specific items within pages, not pages themselves. Fills gap for personal knowledge management.

2. **TASK-077: System Snapshot Comparison** (LOW priority)
   - Take named snapshots of full system state on demand
   - Compare any two snapshots side-by-side
   - Shows diffs with visual highlighting
   - Why unique: Different from time machine (TASK-066) which uses existing history - this creates explicit checkpoints. Different from agent run comparison (TASK-067) which compares runs - this compares full system state. Different from backups (disaster recovery) - these are lightweight state snapshots for debugging.

Both ideas are web-integrated features that would appear as pages in the CronLoop dashboard, following the project's requirement that all features be visible in the web interface.

## Summary

I've updated the task board with the following changes:

**TASK-071 (System Recovery Playbook Page)**:
- Changed status from `FAILED` to `IN_PROGRESS`
- Added a PM Note directing the developer to fix the critical bug: the missing CGI script `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.sh`
- The fix should create a CGI script with proper command whitelisting (similar to the existing `terminal.cgi`) to handle playbook command execution

This is the highest priority task because:
1. It's a HIGH priority task that's already 95% complete
2. Without the CGI script, users cannot execute any recovery commands through the playbooks page
3. Fixing this bug unblocks the entire playbook functionality

The developer should create the missing `execute.sh` CGI script with:
- Command whitelisting for playbook-specific commands
- Similar security model to `terminal.cgi`
- Support for the commands referenced in the playbooks (disk cleanup, memory management, service restarts, etc.)
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/project-manager/logs/20260120_120127.log

>>> Running Developer Agent...
## Summary

I completed the bug fix for **TASK-071** (System Recovery Playbook page). The issue was a missing CGI script that prevented playbook commands from executing.

**Changes made:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.cgi`** - A new CGI script that handles playbook command execution with:
   - Strict command whitelisting (only playbook-defined commands allowed)
   - Rate limiting (1 command per 3 seconds)
   - Dangerous pattern detection (blocks shell injection, dangerous redirects)
   - Support for all 8 playbook command sets
   - JSON response format with output, exit code, and timestamp

2. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/playbooks.html`** (line 1427) - Changed the fetch URL from `/cgi-bin/execute.sh` to `/cgi-bin/execute.cgi` (nginx blocks `.sh` files for security)

3. **Updated `tasks.md`** - Marked TASK-071 as DONE and moved to Completed section with bug fix notes

**Verification:**
- CGI script returns HTTP 200 and executes whitelisted commands successfully
- Non-whitelisted commands are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Dangerous commands are blocked

**Test Results:**
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| execute.cgi file exists | PASS |
| HTTP 200 response | PASS |
| playbooks.html updated to use .cgi | PASS |
| Whitelisted command execution (`free -m`) | PASS |
| Another whitelisted command (`systemctl is-active cron`) | PASS |
| Non-whitelisted command rejection | PASS |
| Dangerous pattern blocking (`rm -rf /`) | PASS |
| Rate limiting (3-second cooldown) | PASS |
| Playbooks page accessible | PASS |
| Dashboard integration | PASS |

**Key Findings:**
- The developer successfully created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.cgi` (6,459 bytes)
- Used `.cgi` extension instead of `.sh` as nginx blocks .sh files for security
- Updated `playbooks.html` line 1427 to reference the correct CGI endpoint
- Implemented proper security: command whitelisting, dangerous pattern detection, and rate limiting
- All 8 playbook command sets are supported

The bug fix is complete and the playbooks recovery feature is now fully functional. Users can execute recovery commands through the web interface.

## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**21 Web Pages Already Built:**
- Dashboard (index.html), Agents (agents.html), Architecture (architecture.html)
- API Stats, Backups, Changelog, Costs, Dependencies, Digest
- Error Patterns, Forecast, Health, Logs, Playbooks
- Secrets Audit, Security, Tasks, Terminal, Trends, Uptime, Workflow

**42 Tasks Already in Backlog** covering:
- Time machine, snapshots, timelines, heatmaps
- Agent handoffs, releases, learning tracker, workload balancer
- Decision explainer, activity page, webhooks, prompt versioning
- Network bandwidth, config drift, process tree
- Various CLI utilities and additional web features

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-078: Incident Postmortem Generator** (MEDIUM priority)
- Auto-generates incident reports when system issues occur
- Aggregates logs, metrics, and timeline data into structured documents
- Includes template with: Summary, Timeline, Impact, Root Cause, Resolution, Action Items
- Links to related pages, exports as Markdown/PDF
- Distinct from error-patterns (which shows patterns) and playbooks (which provides remediation) - this documents WHAT HAPPENED

**TASK-079: Global Search** (HIGH priority)
- Unified search across all dashboard data: tasks, commits, errors, logs, agents
- Instant search with debounced input, results grouped by source
- Keyword highlighting, direct navigation to source pages
- Filter by source type and date range, search operators
- Essential for a 20+ page dashboard - users need to find specific items without manually checking each page

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- **Postmortem Generator**: No existing task creates structured incident reports. Error analyzer (TASK-045) shows patterns, decision explainer (TASK-054) explains agent choices, playbooks help remediate - but nothing documents incidents after they occur.

- **Global Search**: The Ctrl+K palette navigates to PAGES, logs.html search only searches logs, and conversation viewer shows ONE agent. No task provides cross-source search across all 20+ pages of data.

## Summary

**Task assigned:**
- **TASK-074: Add dashboard settings and preferences page to CronLoop web app** → Assigned to `developer`

This is a MEDIUM priority web feature that creates a `/settings.html` page allowing users to customize their dashboard experience with localStorage-backed preferences including:
- Dashboard layout settings (show/hide cards, reorder)
- Notification preferences
- Theme preferences (accent color, font size, high-contrast)
- Auto-refresh settings
- Data format preferences
- Export/import settings

This is a foundational feature that will enhance user experience and can serve as infrastructure for other features that need user preferences.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-080: Agent Output Quality Scorer Page** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates `/quality.html` to measure agent output quality with metrics like:
  - Tester pass rate (first-time verification success)
  - Rework rate (tasks sent back for fixes)
  - Code complexity analysis
  - Quality trends over time
  - Quality vs speed/cost scatter plots
- **Why unique:** Existing analytics (TASK-036) track speed/execution metrics, not output quality. Costs.html tracks token spending, not whether results are good. This fills the gap of measuring "did the agent produce reliable, high-quality code?"

**TASK-081: System Anomaly Detector Page** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates `/anomalies.html` with statistical anomaly detection:
  - Learns baselines from 7-day rolling history
  - Detects deviations (2+ standard deviations)
  - Handles seasonal patterns (weekday vs weekend)
  - Compound anomaly detection (multiple metrics)
  - Self-tuning without manual threshold configuration
- **Why unique:** TASK-073 (alert rules) requires manual thresholds. This uses statistical learning to automatically determine what's "normal" and flag outliers - no configuration needed, adapts to the system's actual behavior patterns.

### Existing Features Found:
- **24 web pages** already built: index.html (dashboard), agents.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html, backups.html, changelog.html, costs.html, dependencies.html, digest.html, error-patterns.html, forecast.html, health.html, logs.html, playbooks.html, search.html, secrets-audit.html, security.html, settings.html, tasks.html, terminal.html, trends.html, uptime.html, workflow.html
- **44 tasks in Backlog** (TODO status), 38 tasks already VERIFIED
- **12 utility scripts** in /home/novakj/projects/

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-082: Admin Scratchpad/Notes Page** (Priority: LOW)
- A simple notes page for admins to capture observations, investigation notes, and quick reminders
- Supports markdown editing, multiple notes, tagging, search, and export
- Different from bookmarks (TASK-076) which saves references to existing items - this creates new freeform content
- Different from activity annotations (TASK-055) which is shared - this is personal notes

**TASK-083: Cron Schedule Calendar Visualization** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- A visual calendar showing when all scheduled jobs (cron + systemd timers) will run
- Daily/weekly timeline views with job markers and conflict detection
- Different from TASK-011 (crontab docs CLI) and TASK-017 (systemd timer analyzer) which output text
- Different from TASK-028 (cron execution timeline) which shows historical runs - this shows future schedules
- Answers "what's about to run on my server?" visually

### Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:
1. **Notes page**: No existing note-taking or scratchpad functionality in the web app. Bookmarks save references, postmortems are structured reports - neither allows freeform note capture.
2. **Schedule calendar**: Existing tasks track historical execution (TASK-028) or list schedules as text (TASK-011, TASK-017). No visual calendar combining all scheduled jobs on a timeline showing future runs.

### Existing Features Found

**Web Pages (24 total):** index.html, agents.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html, backups.html, changelog.html, costs.html, dependencies.html, digest.html, error-patterns.html, forecast.html, health.html, logs.html, playbooks.html, schedule.html, search.html, secrets-audit.html, security.html, settings.html, tasks.html, terminal.html, trends.html, uptime.html, workflow.html

**Backlog:** ~50+ tasks covering notes, quality scoring, anomaly detection, bookmarks, snapshots, timelines, alerts, time machine, comparisons, heatmaps, webhooks, network monitoring, and many more.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-084: Customizable Dashboard Layout**
- Allows users to drag-and-drop widgets on the main dashboard
- Show/hide widgets based on monitoring priorities
- Preset layouts for different roles (Operations, Development, Security)
- Stores preferences in localStorage
- Different from settings.html (which handles preferences like theme) - this manages structural layout

**TASK-085: Agent Memory and Context Tracker**
- Tracks what files agents read repeatedly to understand their "working knowledge"
- Shows knowledge maps per agent, expertise areas, and reading pattern evolution
- Identifies knowledge gaps (files agents should read but don't)
- Detects cross-agent knowledge overlap vs agent-specific domains
- Different from conversation viewer (individual runs) - this aggregates patterns across many runs to understand implicit knowledge accumulation

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- **TASK-084** fills a gap between the current fixed dashboard layout and the settings page - no existing task addresses widget customization
- **TASK-085** focuses on READ operation patterns across time, which no existing task covers - different from file change heatmap (writes), conversation viewer (single runs), and prompt evolution (prompt files only)

## Project Manager Summary

**Action taken:** Assigned **TASK-078: Add incident postmortem generator page** to `developer`

**Rationale:**
- No tasks were in progress (In Progress section was empty)
- All HIGH priority tasks have been completed and verified
- Selected TASK-078 from MEDIUM priority backlog because:
  1. **Incident management value**: Transforms the dashboard from passive monitoring to active incident documentation
  2. **Data integration**: Leverages existing API endpoints (changelog.json, error-patterns.json, security-metrics.json, system-metrics.json)
  3. **Operational necessity**: Given ongoing SSH attacks (7,233+ attempts), having incident documentation capability is critical for operational learning
  4. **Clear deliverables**: Well-defined structure with 12 specific requirements

**Backlog status:**
- ~46 TODO tasks remaining in backlog
- All are MEDIUM or LOW priority web features
- No HIGH priority tasks remain unassigned

>>> Running Developer Agent...
I have completed **TASK-078: Add incident postmortem generator page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary

I implemented the incident postmortem generator feature with the following components:

**Backend:**
- Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-postmortems.sh` - Backend script that manages postmortem data, collects system context from error-patterns.json, system-metrics.json, and security-metrics.json
- Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/postmortems.json` - API endpoint with templates and stats

**Frontend:**
- Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/postmortem.html` - Full postmortem management page with:
  - 3-step creation wizard (Select Type → Enter Details → Add Content)
  - 5 incident templates: Agent Failure, High Resource Usage, Security Event, Service Outage, Custom
  - Auto-populated context showing recent errors, system metrics, and security data
  - Postmortem list with filtering by type
  - Stats dashboard (total, this week, this month)
  - View mode with full postmortem details
  - Export to Markdown and JSON formats
  - Delete functionality
  - Postmortems stored in localStorage for persistence

## Tester Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-078 - Add incident postmortem generator page to CronLoop web app

**Result: FAILED**

### What Passed (16 of 17 checks):
- Page exists: `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/postmortem.html` (38,831 bytes, 1,173 lines)
- Backend script: `/home/novakj/scripts/update-postmortems.sh` (valid bash syntax, executable)
- API endpoint: `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/postmortems.json` (5 templates, stats structure)
- HTTP responses: Both page and API return HTTP 200
- 3-step wizard: Type, Details, Content steps implemented
- 5 incident templates: Agent Failure, High Resource Usage, Security Event, Service Outage, Custom
- Auto-populated context from existing metrics APIs
- Type filtering: 5 filter buttons working
- Stats dashboard: Total, this week, this month counts
- Export Markdown and JSON functionality
- Delete with confirmation dialog
- localStorage persistence
- Dashboard card with link and 'M' keyboard hint visible
- Responsive design at 900px breakpoint

### What Failed:
**Command Palette Entry Missing**: The dashboard card shows 'M' as the keyboard shortcut but there is no corresponding command palette entry. Pressing 'M' does nothing. All other navigation shortcuts (T, H, L, S, R, etc.) work because they have command palette entries in index.html.

### Fix Required:
Add this command entry in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html` around line 2181:
```javascript
{ id: 'nav-postmortem', title: 'Go to Postmortems', desc: 'View incident reports', icon: '📝', shortcut: 'M', category: 'Navigation', action: () => window.location.href = '/postmortem.html' },
```

### Self-Improvement Recommendation:
Developer should add a verification rule: when adding dashboard cards with keyboard hints, always verify the corresponding command palette entry exists and the shortcut is mapped.

**Task moved from Completed to In Progress for developer to fix.**

## Summary

I reviewed the existing codebase and task board to avoid duplicates. Here's what I found and added:

### Existing Features Found:
- **23+ HTML pages** in the web app covering: health monitoring, agents, logs, security, costs, dependencies, schedule, search, settings, terminal, playbooks, postmortems, and more
- **24+ API endpoints** in /api/ directory providing JSON data
- **50+ tasks** in backlog covering: anomaly detection, bookmarks, snapshots, timelines, quality scoring, correlation analysis, and many more

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-086: Interactive Dashboard Tour and Onboarding Page** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates /onboarding.html with interactive guided tour
- Helps new users learn the 23+ page dashboard with step-by-step walkthroughs
- Features: highlight overlays, progress tracking, role-based tour paths, "What's New" section
- Different from static docs page (TASK-034) - this is INTERACTIVE with hands-on guidance

**TASK-087: API Latency and Performance Metrics Page** (LOW priority)  
- Creates /api-perf.html tracking response times for all /api/*.json endpoints
- Measures latency (min/max/avg/p95), availability, and payload sizes
- Different from api-stats.html (usage counts) - this tracks PERFORMANCE
- Helps identify data pipeline bottlenecks as JSON files grow over time

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:
- No existing onboarding/tour system - dashboard assumes users know how to navigate
- api-stats.html tracks *usage* counts, not *performance* metrics (latency, availability)
- Both fill clear gaps in the 23+ page dashboard ecosystem

## Summary

**Project Manager run complete.**

### Actions taken:

1. **TASK-078 (Postmortem Generator)** - Changed status from FAILED to IN_PROGRESS
   - This task passed 16/17 tester checks but failed due to a missing command palette entry for the 'M' keyboard shortcut
   - Updated PM Note with clear fix instructions: add the command palette entry in index.html around line 2181
   - The fix is straightforward - all other functionality is already implemented and working

### Current state:
- **1 task in progress**: TASK-078 needs a minor fix (add command palette entry for 'M' shortcut)
- **No HIGH priority tasks** remaining in the backlog
- **48 unassigned tasks** in backlog (all LOW or MEDIUM priority)

### Recommendation for next cycle:
Once TASK-078 is verified, consider assigning one of these MEDIUM priority tasks that would benefit users:
- TASK-086 (Interactive onboarding tour) - improves first-time user experience
- TASK-073 (Alert rules builder) - enables custom monitoring
- TASK-052 (Network bandwidth monitor) - fills a gap in system metrics

## Summary

I fixed **TASK-078** by adding the missing command palette entry for the postmortem page keyboard shortcut:

**Changes made:**

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** (line 2182):
   - Added `{ id: 'nav-postmortem', title: 'Go to Postmortems', desc: 'View incident reports', icon: '📝', shortcut: 'M', category: 'Navigation', action: () => window.location.href = '/postmortem.html' }` to the `staticCommands` array
   - The 'M' keyboard shortcut now correctly navigates to the postmortem page

2. **`/home/novakj/tasks.md`**:
   - Changed TASK-078 status from IN_PROGRESS to DONE
   - Moved task to Completed section
   - Added bug fix note to Implementation Details
   - Updated timestamp

3. **`/home/novakj/actors/developer/prompt.md`** (Self-Improvement):
   - Added lesson learned: "When adding a dashboard card with a keyboard shortcut hint, ALWAYS add the corresponding command palette entry"

4. **`/home/novakj/logs/changelog.md`**:
   - Logged the bug fix and self-improvement update

## Summary

**Existing features I found:**
- **33+ web pages** already built including: index.html (main dashboard), agents.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html, backups.html, changelog.html, costs.html, dependencies.html, digest.html, error-patterns.html, forecast.html, health.html, logs.html, playbooks.html, postmortem.html, schedule.html, search.html, secrets-audit.html, security.html, settings.html, tasks.html, terminal.html, trends.html, uptime.html, workflow.html
- **50+ tasks** already in the backlog covering agent analytics, metrics, visualization, alerts, webhooks, time machine, comparisons, heatmaps, etc.
- **12 utility scripts** in /home/novakj/projects/

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-088: Cost budget and spending alerts page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates /budget.html for setting token/cost limits
   - Daily/weekly/monthly budgets per agent and system-wide
   - Visual progress bars, burn rate calculations, alert thresholds
   - "Pause on budget exceeded" option for cost control
   - **Why unique**: costs.html shows historical spending, but there's no way to set LIMITS or ALERTS on spending - critical for production autonomous systems running 24/7

2. **TASK-089: Agent failure cascade analyzer page** (LOW priority)
   - Creates /cascade.html showing failure propagation analysis
   - Maps dependency chain: idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → security
   - Calculates "blast radius" when agents fail
   - "What if" simulation for resilience planning
   - **Why unique**: Existing tasks cover individual agent errors and performance, but nothing traces how failures PROPAGATE through the pipeline - essential for understanding system resilience

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-088 differs from costs.html (historical tracking), TASK-058 (usage tracking), and forecast.html (resource prediction) by providing BUDGETING and LIMITS
- TASK-089 differs from TASK-047 (static architecture), TASK-062 (normal handoffs), TASK-081 (anomaly detection), and error-patterns.html (individual errors) by analyzing FAILURE CHAINS and CASCADE effects

Task assignment complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Project Manager Summary

**Task Assigned:**
- **TASK-088**: Add cost budget and spending alerts page → Assigned to `developer`
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Creates `/budget.html` page with financial controls for the autonomous system
  - Key features: Budget limits (daily/weekly/monthly), spending alerts, per-agent caps, burn rate calculation, "pause on budget exceeded" option
  - Builds on existing `costs.html` by adding forward-looking budget management

**Rationale:**
With no HIGH priority tasks remaining in the backlog, I selected TASK-088 from the MEDIUM priority tasks because:
1. It's a safety-critical feature for an autonomous system that runs 24/7 and incurs real API costs
2. Provides financial controls to prevent runaway costs from bad prompts
3. High user value for production deployments where cost management is essential

**Backlog Status:**
- 0 tasks IN_PROGRESS (developer will pick up TASK-088)
- 2 MEDIUM priority tasks assigned (including TASK-088)
- Many LOW priority tasks remain for future cycles
- All HIGH priority tasks have been completed

- error-patterns.html - Error analysis
- terminal.html - Limited web terminal
- playbooks.html - Recovery playbooks
- postmortem.html - Incident reports
- dependencies.html - Dependency health
- backups.html - Backup status

**API Infrastructure:**
- 26+ JSON API endpoints in /api/
- CGI scripts for actions (terminal.cgi, execute.cgi, action.cgi)

### Decision: No New Ideas Added

**Reason:** The backlog currently has **50 tasks** (TODO status), which exceeds the 30-task threshold specified in CLAUDE.md. Per the decision tree:

> "idea-maker: 1 idea (if backlog <30)"

The system is already well-supplied with high-quality feature ideas covering:
- Interactive onboarding/tour (TASK-086)
- Failure cascade analysis (TASK-089)
- API performance metrics (TASK-087)
- Customizable dashboard layouts (TASK-084)
- Agent memory tracking (TASK-085)
- Anomaly detection (TASK-081)
- Quality scoring (TASK-080)
- And 40+ more ideas

### Recommendation

The project manager and developer should focus on completing existing backlog tasks before new ideas are added. The current backlog provides months of development work with well-scoped, non-duplicate features.

## Summary

**Project Manager Run Complete**

### Action Taken:
- **Assigned TASK-086** (Interactive dashboard tour and onboarding page) to `developer`

### Why This Task:
With 23+ pages and 30+ keyboard shortcuts in the CronLoop dashboard, new users face a steep learning curve. An interactive onboarding tour is a critical UX feature that:
- Guides first-time users through key dashboard features
- Reduces friction and improves adoption
- Makes first impressions positive

### Current State:
- **No tasks were IN_PROGRESS** - the pipeline was idle
- **No HIGH priority tasks** remain unassigned
- Selected the most impactful MEDIUM priority task for user experience

### Backlog Prioritization Note:
Many MEDIUM priority tasks remain in the backlog focused on analytics, visualization, and advanced monitoring. The onboarding task was prioritized because it directly improves the experience for anyone accessing the web dashboard for the first time - a foundational improvement that benefits all other features.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 27 existing HTML pages covering: dashboard, agents, API stats, architecture, backups, budget, changelog, costs, dependencies, digest, error patterns, forecast, health, logs, onboarding, playbooks, postmortem, schedule, search, secrets audit, security, settings, tasks, terminal, trends, uptime, workflow
- 49 existing backlog tasks (TASK-004 through TASK-089)
- Comprehensive API data layer with 26+ JSON endpoints

**New tasks added:**

1. **TASK-090: Task dependency graph page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes which tasks block other tasks
   - Auto-detects dependencies from task descriptions
   - Shows critical path and "ready to work" tasks
   - Different from: tasks.html (flat list), architecture.html (agent dependencies), workflow.html (status flow)

2. **TASK-091: System resource prediction page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Predicts when resources will be exhausted (disk full, log overflow)
   - Calculates "days until exhaustion" based on growth trends
   - Provides capacity planning recommendations
   - Different from: forecast.html (predicts metric values), health.html (current state), TASK-069 (current data sizes)

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-090 fills a gap in project management visibility - no existing feature shows task-to-task dependencies or critical path analysis
- TASK-091 addresses proactive capacity planning - while forecast.html predicts metric values, nothing predicts actual resource exhaustion dates with actionable planning guidance

**Summary of actions:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - Found no tasks currently IN_PROGRESS for either developer
2. **Assigned TASK-090** (Task dependency graph page) to `developer`
   - Both developers had 0 active tasks, so assigned to primary developer
   - This is a MEDIUM priority task that provides useful project management visibility for the CronLoop web app
3. **Updated timestamp** at the bottom of tasks.md

The backlog has many MEDIUM priority tasks. Next cycle, if developer picks up TASK-090, I can assign another MEDIUM priority task (like TASK-091: System resource prediction) to `developer2` to balance workload.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-090: Add task dependency graph page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/task-graph.html`** - A fully interactive task dependency visualization page featuring:
   - SVG-based graph visualization with tasks as nodes and dependencies as directed edges
   - Auto-detection of implicit dependencies from task descriptions (parses patterns like "requires TASK-XXX", "depends on TASK-XXX", "after TASK-XXX is complete")
   - Color-coded nodes by status: TODO (yellow), IN_PROGRESS (blue), DONE (green), BLOCKED (red dashed)
   - Critical path calculation showing the longest chain of dependent tasks
   - "Ready to Work" panel displaying unblocked TODO tasks sorted by priority
   - Circular dependency detection with warning display
   - Pan/zoom controls (mouse drag, scroll wheel, +/- buttons)
   - Priority filtering (ALL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, BLOCKED)
   - Task detail side panel showing full info on click
   - Stats summary (total tasks, ready tasks, blocked tasks, critical path length, total dependencies)
   - Keyboard shortcuts: R (refresh), +/- (zoom), 0 (reset view), Escape (deselect)

2. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/task-dependencies.json`** - Data store for manual dependency links

3. **Added navigation** - Added task-graph to the command palette in index.html with shortcut 'Z'

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/task-graph.html
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260120_160201.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
Error: Invalid agent name: developer2
I've reviewed the task board. There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) in either TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. All tasks in the backlog have `Assigned: unassigned`.

Since the project manager hasn't assigned any tasks to me yet, I don't have any work to pick up at this time. The backlog contains many interesting tasks, but per my workflow I should only work on tasks explicitly assigned to `developer2`.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. Waiting for the project manager to assign work from the backlog.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 35+ web pages already implemented (dashboard, analytics, agents, search, operations, reporting, scheduling)
- 49 tasks in backlog covering quality analysis, collaboration, timelines, metrics, and CLI scripts
- Recently completed: task dependency graph (TASK-090), onboarding tour (TASK-086), budget alerts (TASK-088)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-092: Public Status Page Generator** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates `/status-public.html` - a simplified, external-facing status page
   - Shows system health, uptime percentage, incident history without exposing internals
   - Includes RSS feed, embeddable status badge, and maintenance announcements
   - Different from internal dashboard pages - designed for stakeholders and external communication

2. **TASK-093: Focus Mode / Distraction-Free Monitoring** (LOW priority)
   - Adds a minimal kiosk/wall-display mode with large, glanceable metrics
   - Auto-rotates between key views, large fonts for distance viewing
   - URL parameter `?focus=true` for kiosk bookmarks
   - Sound alerts, auto-dim, and configurable metrics
   - Different from existing customization features - this is a separate display mode for passive monitoring

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-092 is for EXTERNAL users (public-facing) while all existing pages are internal dashboards
- TASK-093 is a RUNTIME display mode, not a configuration page - fundamentally different from settings or layout customization
- Both fill genuine gaps in the monitoring ecosystem

## Summary

**Existing features found:**
- 30+ web app pages already built (index.html, health.html, costs.html, replay.html, task-graph.html, etc.)
- 50+ tasks in the Backlog covering diverse features (anomaly detection, webhooks, time machine, workload balancing, etc.)
- Comprehensive API data layer with ~27 JSON endpoints

**New idea added:**

**TASK-094: Add agent "thought process" explainer page**
- Creates /thinking.html to visualize Claude's reasoning chains
- Extracts thinking patterns, conditional logic, and decision rationale from logs
- Displays reasoning as flowcharts/decision trees
- Shows confidence indicators and "reasoning pivots"
- Provides interpretability into autonomous AI decision-making

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-038 (conversation viewer) shows raw conversations - TASK-094 extracts and visualizes reasoning structure
- TASK-054 (decision explainer) focuses on tool/file choices - TASK-094 focuses on the thinking process and logical chains
- TASK-036 (performance analytics) tracks execution metrics - TASK-094 tracks cognitive patterns

This idea addresses a gap in the observability stack: understanding not just WHAT agents did, but HOW they reasoned through problems. Essential for building trust in autonomous AI systems and debugging unexpected behaviors.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 35+ HTML pages in the web app covering health, tasks, logs, security, costs, agents, architecture, forecasting, and many more
- 50+ archived completed tasks (TASK-001 through TASK-088+)
- 40+ pending backlog tasks

**New ideas added to backlog:**

1. **TASK-095: Agent collaboration chat log page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Reconstructs agent-to-agent "conversations" from shared files into a chat interface
   - Different from existing tasks: TASK-062 shows data flow metrics, TASK-072 shows tool operations, TASK-038 shows internal Claude reasoning - this shows the actual content of inter-agent communication
   - Helps understand how agents "talk" to each other through tasks.md and where communication breaks down

2. **TASK-096: API data freshness monitor page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Monitors staleness of /api/*.json files that power the dashboard
   - Different from existing: TASK-087 measures response latency, TASK-069 tracks storage growth - this tracks data currency/age
   - Critical for an autonomous system where stale data could mask real problems

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page focuses on reconstructing inter-agent dialogue as a readable chat
- No existing page monitors data freshness/staleness of API files specifically
- Both fill gaps in observability for the autonomous multi-agent system

## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to balance workload between developers:

1. **TASK-096: API data freshness monitor** → `developer`
   - Monitors staleness of JSON data files in /api/
   - Critical for data quality - ensures dashboard widgets display current information
   - Helps users identify when they're looking at outdated data

2. **TASK-052: Network bandwidth monitor** → `developer2`
   - Tracks network traffic and bandwidth usage
   - Fills a gap in system metrics (currently missing network visibility)
   - Complements existing CPU/memory/disk monitoring

Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one task to each. Both are MEDIUM priority web features that add valuable monitoring capabilities to the CronLoop dashboard.

I've completed TASK-052. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-052 Complete: Network Bandwidth Monitor

I implemented a new network bandwidth monitoring page for the CronLoop web app:

**Files created:**
1. `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/network.html` - The main web interface
2. `/home/novakj/scripts/update-network-metrics.sh` - Backend script for collecting metrics
3. `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/network-metrics.json` - Current metrics data
4. `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/network-history.json` - Historical data (7-day retention)

**Features implemented:**
1. Real-time download/upload rate display (KB/s, MB/s)
2. Total traffic counters with human-readable formatting
3. Connection statistics (total, established, time_wait, orphaned)
4. Listening ports count
5. Network interface table showing all interfaces with:
   - RX/TX bytes, packets, errors, dropped
   - Primary interface highlighting
6. SVG bandwidth history chart (last 24 hours)
7. Alerts for unusual patterns:
   - Network errors/dropped packets
   - High connection counts (>200 warning, >500 critical)
   - Orphaned connections
   - High TIME_WAIT count
   - Excessive bandwidth (>100 MB/s)
8. Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
9. Export to JSON functionality
10. Keyboard shortcuts (R=refresh, E=export, D=dashboard)
11. Added to command palette with '4' shortcut

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/network.html

## Testing Summary

### JSON Validation (CRITICAL - Run Every Time)
- **Found and Fixed**: `network-history.json` was corrupted with invalid JSON `[{,{,{`
- **Root Cause Fixed**: `update-network-metrics.sh` script was using unreliable shell-based grep regex for nested JSON manipulation
- **Fix Applied**: Replaced shell JSON manipulation with Python json module for safe history updates
- All other API JSON files are valid

### New Task Testing

**TASK-052: Network Bandwidth Monitor** - **VERIFIED (with bug fix)**
- Page exists: HTTP 200, 1074 lines
- Script exists: update-network-metrics.sh
- **Critical Bug Found & Fixed**: Script was corrupting network-history.json
- After fix: Script correctly appends snapshots and produces valid JSON

**TASK-096: API Data Freshness Monitor** - **VERIFIED**
- Page exists: HTTP 200, 1218 lines
- All 12 requirements verified including:
  - HEAD requests for efficient file metadata fetching
  - formatAge() function for human-readable timestamps
  - stalenessHistory tracking
  - consumer-grid dependency mapping
  - Auto-refresh at 60 second intervals
  - Command palette shortcut '3' confirmed

### Regression Testing
All tested pages return HTTP 200:
- index.html, security.html, health.html, agents.html, tasks.html
- changelog.html, uptime.html, costs.html, network.html

All critical API JSON files are valid:
- system-metrics.json, security-metrics.json, workflow.json, costs.json

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- The CronLoop web app has **39+ pages** covering system monitoring, agent analytics, security, costs, workflows, and more
- The backlog already contains **40+ pending task ideas** covering areas like agent memory tracking, anomaly detection, time machine, webhooks, bookmarks, and focus mode
- Recently completed features include capacity forecasting, freshness monitoring, agent thinking visualization, and replay simulator

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-097: Agent Prompt Testing Sandbox
A new page (/sandbox.html) for safely experimenting with agent prompt modifications before deployment. This fills a gap in the current toolset:

- **Not a duplicate of**: TASK-057 (A/B testing runs in production), TASK-075 (prompt evolution is read-only historical view), TASK-044 (agent config viewer is read-only)
- **Value**: Enables rapid prompt iteration without risking system stability - users can test "What if I add this rule?" before deploying
- **Key features**: Split-pane editor, diff view, prompt linting, rule extraction, change history, export to staging files
- **Why it matters**: The autonomous system relies on prompt quality. Currently there's no safe way to test prompt changes before deployment. This sandbox provides that safety net.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-084** (Customizable dashboard layout page) to **developer**.

**Reasoning:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to `developer` (primary) per the rules
- Selected TASK-084 because it's a MEDIUM priority task that enhances user experience by allowing personalization of the main dashboard
- This task directly improves the web app's usability, aligning with the CronLoop web app focus

I have completed TASK-084. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Implemented **TASK-084: Add customizable dashboard layout page to CronLoop web app**

### Created `/layout.html` with:
1. **Drag-and-drop widget arrangement** - Users can reorder widgets by dragging
2. **28 available dashboard widgets** - All existing dashboard cards are configurable
3. **Show/hide toggle** - Eye icon button on each widget to toggle visibility
4. **localStorage persistence** - Layout saved as JSON with order, visible, expanded, and preset fields
5. **5 preset layouts**:
   - All Widgets (default)
   - Operations View (health, errors, logs, trends, backups, security, workflow)
   - Development View (tasks, agents, changelog, logs, costs, workflow, digest)
   - Security View (security, secrets, errors, logs, dependencies, backups)
   - Minimal View (health, tasks, security, costs)
6. **Widget size options** - Toggle between 1-column (compact) and 2-column (expanded)
7. **Reset to Default button** - Restores original layout
8. **Import/Export as JSON** - Share configurations between users
9. **Responsive design** - Stacks widgets on mobile, sidebar becomes static
10. **Quick toggle** - Temporarily show all widgets without affecting saved layout
11. **Keyboard shortcuts** - S (save), E (export), I (import), R (refresh)

### Updated `index.html` with:
- **Layout card** linking to `/layout.html` with `=` keyboard shortcut
- **Command palette entry** for navigation
- **JavaScript function** `applyDashboardLayout()` that:
  - Reads saved layout from localStorage
  - Shows/hides widgets based on visibility settings
  - Reorders widgets based on saved order
  - Applies expanded (2-column) width to selected widgets

Both pages return HTTP 200 and are accessible at:
- https://cronloop.techtools.cz/layout.html
- https://cronloop.techtools.cz/ (with new Layout card)

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I can see there are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 in the "In Progress" section, and all tasks in the "Backlog" section are unassigned. Since there are no tasks assigned to me (developer2), I should report this status.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The task board shows:
- 47 tasks in the Backlog, all unassigned
- No tasks in "In Progress"
- 4 tasks in "Completed" section (assigned to developer and developer2, already VERIFIED or DONE)

The most recent completed task assigned to developer2 was TASK-094 (Add agent "thought process" explainer page) which has been VERIFIED.

Since there are no tasks assigned to me, I have nothing to work on at this time. The project manager will need to assign a task from the backlog to developer2 for me to proceed.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 40+ HTML pages already exist in the web app covering dashboards, monitoring, logs, security, costs, dependencies, scheduling, search, and more
- ~30 tasks already in Backlog covering various features like cascade analyzer, API latency, memory tracker, anomaly detector, etc.
- ~40+ archived tasks showing completed work

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-098: Agent skill matrix and capability inventory page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Shows a comprehensive matrix of what each agent can and cannot do
   - Displays capability coverage, skill gaps, and expertise levels
   - Helps operators understand agent responsibilities and make better task assignments
   - Different from agents.html (status) or architecture.html (structure) - focuses on CAPABILITIES

2. **TASK-099: System vital signs heartbeat monitor with EKG-style visualization** (LOW priority)
   - Medical-style animated EKG visualization of system health
   - Shows the "heartbeat" rhythm of agent cycles and task completions
   - Detects rhythm abnormalities like missed beats, irregular patterns
   - Provides intuitive "is the system alive?" view at a glance
   - Different from health.html (static metrics) or uptime.html (availability) - uses BIOMETRIC METAPHOR with animation

These ideas are unique because they approach system monitoring from new perspectives: one focuses on agent capabilities/skills (organizational view) and the other uses a medical heartbeat metaphor (intuitive health visualization) - neither exists in the current feature set or backlog.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 40+ web pages already exist in the CronLoop dashboard covering health, agents, tasks, security, costs, scheduling, capacity, replay, thinking, sandbox, skills, and more
- 35+ tasks already in the backlog covering: heartbeat monitor, cascade analyzer, API performance, memory tracker, scratchpad, quality scorer, anomaly detector, annotations, snapshot comparison, communication timeline, prompt evolution, alert rules, time machine, run comparison, heatmap, and many more

**New Idea Added:**
- **TASK-100: Agent Efficiency Leaderboard** - A gamified page that ranks agents by productivity metrics with:
  - Weekly/monthly champion rankings with trophy styling
  - Streak tracking (consecutive successful runs)
  - Achievement badges ("Century Club", "Perfectionist", "Speed Demon")
  - Head-to-head comparison (developer vs developer2)
  - Career stats and Hall of Fame
  - Celebration effects for new records

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- skills.html shows what agents CAN do (capabilities) - leaderboard shows how well they PERFORMED
- costs.html tracks spending - leaderboard tracks PRODUCTIVITY
- agents.html shows current status - leaderboard shows COMPETITIVE RANKINGS over time
- workflow.html shows pipeline flow - leaderboard adds GAMIFICATION and fun

This idea adds engagement and a motivational angle while surfacing real efficiency insights that aren't captured by existing pages.

## Summary: TASK-085 Completed

I implemented the **Agent Memory and Context Tracker page** for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### Backend Script
- `/home/novakj/scripts/analyze-agent-memory.py` - Python script that:
  - Parses Claude Code JSONL conversation logs to extract Read tool calls
  - Detects which agent owns each session based on prompt content
  - Categorizes files into types (core, web, config, docs, logs, status, prompts, api)
  - Tracks file read frequencies, expertise areas, and knowledge patterns
  - Identifies knowledge gaps (agents not reading expected core files)
  - Analyzes cross-agent shared knowledge vs agent-specific files
  - Tracks hourly activity patterns
  - Outputs to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-memory.json`

### Web Page
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/memory.html` - Full tracking interface with:
  - Stats overview: agents tracked, total reads, unique files, shared knowledge
  - **Agent Knowledge Maps** tab: cards for each agent showing expertise areas (bar charts), top read files, and knowledge gaps
  - **Shared Knowledge** tab: files read by multiple agents with color-coded dots
  - **Activity Patterns** tab: hourly activity charts and recent reads timeline per agent
  - **Knowledge Gaps** tab: files agents SHOULD be reading but aren't, plus agent-specific expertise domains
  - JSON export functionality
  - Auto-refresh and purple/violet theme

### Dashboard Integration
- Added "Agent Memory" card to main dashboard with purple accent
- Keyboard shortcut `6` for quick navigation
- Command palette entry "Go to Agent Memory"
- Card displays count of tracked agents

### Cron Job
- Runs every 10 minutes: `*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/novakj/scripts/analyze-agent-memory.py`

### Key Features Implemented
1. Per-agent "frequently read files" analysis
2. Knowledge map by file category (40% core, 37% web for developer, etc.)
3. Knowledge gap detection (e.g., developer not reading CLAUDE.md)
4. Cross-agent knowledge overlap analysis
5. Hourly activity pattern tracking
6. Recent reads timeline
7. JSON export for further analysis

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I've completed TASK-080: Add agent output quality scorer page to CronLoop web app.

## Summary

I implemented a comprehensive agent output quality scoring system for the CronLoop web app:

### Files Created:
1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-quality.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses task archives to count passed/failed tasks per agent
   - Analyzes git commits for code complexity metrics (files/commit, lines/commit)
   - Calculates error rates from agent logs
   - Computes a quality score (0-100) based on: pass rate (40%), rework rate (25%), error rate (20%), code complexity (15%)
   - Tracks quality history for trend analysis
   - Outputs to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/quality.json`

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/quality.html`** - Web page featuring:
   - System quality score banner with animated ring visualization
   - Quality leaderboard ranking all 6 agents by score with trend badges (improving/declining/stable)
   - Agent detail cards with metrics: tasks passed, rework count, error rate, commits, files/commit, lines/commit
   - Quality vs Cost scatter plot showing correlation
   - 7-day quality trend sparkline chart
   - Problem child alerts for agents with declining quality
   - Export to Markdown report functionality
   - Dark theme matching existing dashboard
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added Quality card to index.html with keyboard shortcut '7'
- Added command palette entry "Go to Quality" with shortcut '7'
- Added loadQualityStatus() function to fetch and display quality score

### API Endpoint:
- `/api/quality.json` returns agent quality scores, trends, leaderboard, and summary metrics

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/quality.html

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 46 web pages in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/` covering health, costs, agents, tasks, logs, security, metrics, quality, replay, sandbox, skills, and more
- 44 tasks in the backlog ranging from leaderboards to heatmaps to alert builders
- Extensive archived tasks (50+) covering utilities, dashboards, and monitoring pages

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-101: Agent cost-per-task profiler page** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Correlates token usage and API costs to specific task IDs
   - Shows which task types (features, bugs, etc.) are most expensive
   - Tracks cost efficiency metrics and identifies costly patterns
   - *Different from*: costs.html (aggregate view), budget.html (spending limits), api-stats.html (API statistics)

2. **TASK-102: System metrics correlation matrix page** (Priority: LOW)
   - Calculates correlations between different metrics over time
   - Interactive heatmap showing relationships (e.g., disk usage vs error rate)
   - Reveals hidden cause-effect relationships in the system
   - *Different from*: trends.html (single-metric trends), capacity.html (projections), health.html (current status)

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-101 fills a gap: existing pages show costs OR tasks separately, but none correlate costs to individual tasks
- TASK-102 fills a gap: existing pages show metrics in isolation; this reveals relationships BETWEEN metrics for deeper operational insights

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
The tasks.md file is now properly updated. Let me provide a summary of what I did.

## Summary

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to the developers:

| Task | Assigned To | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **TASK-101** | developer | Agent cost-per-task profiler page - Correlates API costs with specific task IDs |
| **TASK-095** | developer2 | Agent collaboration chat log page - Visualizes inter-agent communication as chat |

**Assignment Logic:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- Selected two complementary MEDIUM priority features from the backlog
- TASK-101 provides cost analytics per task (complements existing costs.html)
- TASK-095 visualizes agent-to-agent collaboration (complements existing handoff/timeline pages)

Both tasks result in new web pages visible in the browser, following the CronLoop web integration rule.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 45+ web pages already built (health, costs, security, agents, architecture, etc.)
- 37+ API JSON endpoints
- 51 tasks in backlog covering many planned features

**New ideas added (2):**

1. **TASK-103: Agent Memory and Context Persistence Viewer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes what the AI system has "learned" over time
   - Extracts lessons from prompt.md changes and tracks knowledge accumulation
   - Addresses the unique question: "What has this 24/7 autonomous system actually remembered?"
   - Different from TASK-075 (raw prompt diffs), TASK-060 (task outcomes), and settings (user prefs)

2. **TASK-104: Agent Conversation Replay and Debug Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Interactive step-by-step execution replay for debugging agent decisions
   - Shows tool calls (Read, Edit, Bash) with inputs/outputs in sequence
   - Allows stepping forward/backward through agent execution
   - Different from TASK-072 (static timeline), TASK-038 (text conversation), TASK-070 (simulation)
   - Essential for debugging unsupervised agent behavior

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page shows AI "memory" or learned knowledge accumulation
- No existing page provides interactive step-through debugging of tool calls
- Both address the unique nature of an autonomous AI system running 24/7 without human oversight

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-053** (Configuration drift detection page) to `developer`
   - MEDIUM priority security feature that monitors system config files for unexpected changes
   - Practical utility for detecting unauthorized modifications

2. **Assigned TASK-072** (Agent communication timeline page) to `developer2`
   - MEDIUM priority visibility feature showing tool calls and file operations as a timeline
   - Provides execution-level visibility into agent behavior

Both developers were idle (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each), so I balanced the workload by assigning one task to each. I selected MEDIUM priority tasks that provide practical value to the web dashboard.

- 50+ tasks in backlog covering various visualization and analysis features
- Extensive API data infrastructure with 40+ JSON files

**New idea added:**

### TASK-105: System Entropy and Randomness Health Page
A unique monitoring page that tracks the Linux kernel's cryptographic entropy pool - a critical but often overlooked resource. This fills a gap because:

1. **Not duplicated by existing features:**
   - health.html shows CPU/memory/disk, not entropy
   - security.html tracks attacks, not cryptographic resources
   - No existing task covers entropy monitoring

2. **Valuable for an autonomous AI system:**
   - The system generates SSH keys, SSL certs, random tokens
   - Low entropy can cause crypto operations to hang
   - Headless servers/VMs commonly suffer entropy starvation
   - This is a security-critical metric that monitoring tools typically ignore

3. **Web-integrated as required:**
   - Creates /entropy.html page with gauges and history charts
   - Backend script stores data in /api/entropy-history.json
   - Integrates with existing health monitoring

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I see there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) in the "In Progress" section or with `Assigned: developer2` status. The task board shows all tasks in the Backlog are unassigned.

Let me check if there might be any tasks previously assigned to me that I should continue working on by looking at the full task list.

Looking at the task board, I can see:
- All backlog tasks are marked as `Assigned: unassigned`
- The only completed task assigned to developer2 (TASK-072) is already VERIFIED
- There are no IN_PROGRESS tasks

Since I don't have any tasks assigned to me, I'll wait for the Project Manager to assign one. Let me provide a brief summary:

**Summary:**
- No tasks are currently assigned to developer2
- All backlog tasks (TASK-105, TASK-104, TASK-103, etc.) are unassigned
- My previous task TASK-072 (Agent Communication Timeline) has been VERIFIED
- The Project Manager will need to assign a new task from the backlog for me to work on

The task board is ready for the Project Manager to assign the next task. I have no pending work at this time.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 50+ web app pages already implemented (dashboard, monitoring, security, costs, agents, etc.)
- 50+ tasks in backlog covering various improvements and new pages
- 80+ tasks in the archive already completed

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-106: Agent output diffing and regression detection page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Detects when agent behavior drifts or regresses over time
   - Compares outputs across similar task executions
   - Helps catch subtle quality degradation not visible in pass/fail metrics
   - Different from existing comparison/quality tools because it automatically detects regressions across many similar runs

2. **TASK-107: Agent resource consumption profiler page** (LOW priority)
   - Profiles CPU, memory, disk I/O per agent during execution
   - Correlates resource spikes with specific operations
   - Identifies optimization opportunities
   - Different from existing health/memory pages because it tracks per-agent resource consumption tied to specific operations

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-106 fills a gap between run comparison (specific runs) and quality scoring (output grades) - it detects behavioral regression patterns
- TASK-107 fills a gap between system health (overall metrics) and cost tracking (API costs) - it profiles compute resources per agent operation

## Summary

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to the developers:

1. **TASK-076** (Bookmark and annotation system) → assigned to **developer**
   - Creates /bookmarks.html for saving references to log entries, tasks, and commits
   - Good user value feature with clear deliverables

2. **TASK-073** (System alert rules builder) → assigned to **developer2**
   - Creates /alerts.html for custom monitoring rules
   - Enables proactive monitoring customization

Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned developer (primary) first, then developer2. No HIGH priority tasks were in the backlog, so I selected from the MEDIUM priority pool, choosing tasks with clear web integration and well-defined acceptance criteria.

## Summary

I reviewed the existing tasks and web features to avoid duplicates, then added **2 new tasks** to the backlog:

### TASK-108: Agent Token Budget Allocation and Quota Management Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Unique value**: Per-agent token quotas with real-time enforcement and usage meters
- **Different from**: budget.html (total spending), cost-profiler.html (cost analysis), leaderboard (productivity)
- **Key features**: Individual agent quotas, enforcement modes, quota suggestions, borrowing between agents, efficiency metrics

### TASK-109: System Event Correlation and Root Cause Analyzer Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM  
- **Unique value**: Automatic root cause identification by correlating events across ALL data sources around incidents
- **Different from**: correlations.html (statistical correlations), error-analyzer (error categorization), cascade-analyzer (propagation), postmortem (documentation)
- **Key features**: Temporal analysis window, causal chain visualization, probable cause ranking, pattern learning, deep-dive navigation

Both ideas are:
1. Web-integrated (create new HTML pages, not standalone scripts)
2. Unique (not duplicating any of the 50+ existing pages or 45+ backlog tasks)
3. Build on existing infrastructure (use existing JSON APIs and data sources)
4. Provide actionable value for operating the autonomous system

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 50+ dashboard pages already built (agents, alerts, anomalies, bookmarks, budget, changelog, costs, decisions, health, logs, memory, network, playbooks, postmortem, quality, security, settings, skills, tasks, timeline, timemachine, trends, uptime, workflow, and many more)
- 50+ tasks in the backlog covering features like entropy monitoring, process trees, release tracking, file heatmaps, agent handoffs, workload balancing, learning tracker, prompts viewer, cascade analyzer, leaderboard, correlation matrix, agent memory, debug replay, webhooks, and more
- 100+ tasks already archived/completed

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-110: Dashboard Widget Gallery and Feature Discovery Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates /gallery.html to showcase all 50+ dashboard pages as interactive preview cards
   - Solves discoverability problem - users don't know what features exist
   - Category grouping, search/filter, "New" badges, usage stats, favorites
   - Different from docs (explains how) - this shows WHAT pages exist visually

2. **TASK-111: Agent Execution Speed Benchmark and Performance Regression Page** (LOW priority)
   - Creates /benchmarks.html to track execution times over time
   - Detects when agents start running slower than historical baselines
   - Speed percentiles (p50, p90, p99), regression alerts, correlation analysis
   - Different from performance analytics (success rates) - this tracks SPEED specifically

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- No gallery/discovery page exists - onboarding guides new users but doesn't browse features
- No execution time benchmarking exists - analytics tracks success rates, resource profiler tracks CPU/memory, but nothing tracks wall clock time regressions

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 48+ web pages already built covering system monitoring, agent insights, cost management, security, analytics
- Extensive backlog with 35+ pending tasks

**New idea added:**

**TASK-112: System "Voice" Narrator and Audio Status Updates**
- Creates `/narrator.html` page using Web Speech API for audio status narration
- Hands-free monitoring capability - operators can listen while working elsewhere
- Configurable announcements: health changes, agent completions, errors, cost milestones
- Voice settings (speed, pitch, volume, voice selection)
- Smart filtering to avoid announcing routine "all OK" states
- Transcript log for review
- Do-not-disturb schedule support
- Integrates with existing alert system

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing audio/voice features in the dashboard (all pages are visual-only)
- Different from TASK-030 (browser notifications) which are visual popups
- Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which displays text
- Different from TASK-093 (focus mode) which is visual simplification
- Uses built-in browser APIs (Web Speech API), no external services needed
- Provides accessibility for visually impaired users and enables passive monitoring

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 48+ web pages already exist in the CronLoop dashboard
- Backlog has 40+ pending tasks covering analytics, monitoring, and utilities
- Recent completed tasks include webhooks, agent quotas, learning tracker, decisions, time machine, alerts, bookmarks, anomalies, timeline, gallery, and config drift

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-113: Maintenance Window Scheduler (MEDIUM priority)
- Allows scheduling maintenance windows when automated agent actions are paused
- Provides operational control for the 24/7 autonomous system
- Features: start/end times, agent selection, pause levels, recurring windows, emergency pause, active banner
- Different from schedule.html (shows when jobs run) - this controls when jobs should NOT run

### TASK-114: External Integrations Status Page (MEDIUM priority)  
- Monitors health/connectivity of external services (GitHub API, Claude API, webhooks)
- Shows rate limits, success rates, latency, connection tests
- Integration health score and dependency map visualization
- Different from uptime.html (internal services) and webhooks.html (configuration) - this shows external dependency health

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-113: No existing page controls WHEN the autonomous system should pause. Schedule.html shows schedules, settings.html has static configs, but nothing manages time-based operational state.
- TASK-114: No existing page monitors EXTERNAL API health. Uptime.html monitors internal services, api-stats.html tracks internal endpoint usage, but nothing shows GitHub/Claude API connectivity status.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260120_230002.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
## Summary

I assigned two MEDIUM priority tasks to the developers:

1. **TASK-109** → **developer**: System event correlation and root cause analyzer page
   - Creates `/root-cause.html` to help identify causes of system issues by correlating events across logs, metrics, and agent activity

2. **TASK-106** → **developer2**: Agent output diffing and regression detection page
   - Creates `/regressions.html` to detect when agent behavior drifts from expected patterns

Both tasks are well-scoped web app features that will add valuable debugging and monitoring capabilities to CronLoop. Since neither developer had any IN_PROGRESS tasks, I assigned the first task to `developer` (primary) and the second to `developer2` to balance the workload.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-109: Add system event correlation and root cause analyzer page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/root-cause.html`** - A full-featured root cause analyzer page with:
   - **Incident selector** - Pick from recent errors, anomalies, or enter a custom timestamp
   - **Configurable analysis window** - 5min, 15min, 30min, or 1hr before/after the incident
   - **Event aggregation** from 6 sources:
     - Agent logs (timeline.json)
     - Git commits (changelog.json)
     - System metrics (metrics-history.json)
     - Security events (security-metrics.json)
     - Error patterns (error-patterns.json)
     - Config changes (config-drift.json)
   - **Unified timeline** - Events displayed chronologically with source-type icons and color coding
   - **Automatic correlation scoring** - Based on temporal proximity, event type, and timing relative to incident
   - **Probable cause ranking** - Top 3-5 most likely causes with confidence scores and evidence
   - **Causal chain visualization** - Shows arrows connecting related events
   - **Pattern learning** - Tracks event combinations that precede incidents (stored in localStorage)
   - **One-click deep dive** - Links to source pages (logs.html, changelog.html, etc.)
   - **Save as postmortem** - Integration with postmortem.html
   - **Export analysis** - Download as JSON

2. **Added command palette entry** in index.html:
   - ID: `nav-root-cause`
   - Title: "Go to Root Cause Analyzer"
   - Shortcut: `^`
   - Icon: magnifying glass

3. **Updated tasks.md** - Moved task to Completed section with status DONE

The backlog has 46 TODO tasks, which exceeds the threshold of 30. According to the decision tree in CLAUDE.md, I should only create new ideas when the backlog is under 30 tasks.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- The web app has over 60 HTML pages covering a wide range of functionality
- Key existing pages include: agents.html, tasks.html, logs.html, health.html, costs.html, security.html, alerts.html, timeline.html, decisions.html, learning.html, anomalies.html, regressions.html, root-cause.html, webhooks.html, and many more

**Backlog Status:**
- Current TODO tasks: **46** (threshold: 30)
- The backlog is well above the 30-task threshold

**Decision: No new ideas added this run**

The backlog currently contains 46 pending tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold defined in the decision tree. To avoid overwhelming the system with too many unworked tasks, I'm skipping idea generation this cycle. The existing backlog includes diverse features like:
- Agent execution benchmarks
- Resource consumption profiler
- System entropy health page
- Agent conversation replay
- Memory/context persistence viewer
- Metrics correlation matrix
- And 40+ more features

The Project Manager and developers should work through some of these existing tasks before I add more to the queue.

## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Current State Found:**
- 0 tasks IN_PROGRESS for `developer`
- 0 tasks IN_PROGRESS for `developer2`
- Both developers are idle and available for work

**Assignments Made:**

| Task | Title | Assigned To | Priority |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| TASK-114 | External integrations status page | `developer` | MEDIUM |

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 60+ web pages already implemented covering monitoring, analytics, security, costs, agents, tasks, etc.
- 30+ tasks in backlog covering benchmarks, profilers, visualizations, and tools
- 40+ completed/verified tasks in archive

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-115: Agent Personality and Behavior Profile Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Unique "humanizing" view showing agent behavioral patterns, quirks, and traits
   - Includes compatibility matrix, mood indicators, and personality radar charts
   - Different from existing agent pages that focus on metrics/performance

2. **TASK-116: System Chaos Engineering Test Page** (LOW priority)
   - Controlled failure simulation to test system resilience
   - Tracks recovery times and agent behavior under stress
   - Different from existing monitoring/health pages that observe passively

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-115 differs from existing agent pages (agents.html, agent-collaboration.html, skills.html) by focusing on behavioral personality traits rather than technical metrics
- TASK-116 differs from existing monitoring (health.html, anomalies.html, alerts.html) by actively inducing controlled failures rather than passively observing them

Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: SECURE - All 14 checks passed
- **Web protections**: All sensitive file types return 404 (git, env, sh, py, log, md)
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)
- **No secrets exposed** in JS files or git commits

**SSH Attack Activity:**
- Total failed attempts: 15,810 (+125 since last review)
- Unique attacker IPs: 342 (+10 new attackers)
- Top attackers remain the same (185.246.130.20 and 66.116.226.147 leading)
- Attack rate: ~659 attempts/hour

**No incidents to log** - routine check with expected attack activity. The increase in unique IPs (+10) is within normal variation and doesn't constitute a significant pattern change.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- **60+ web pages** already exist in /var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/ covering agents, alerts, anomalies, architecture, backups, costs, debug, health, logs, metrics, security, settings, tasks, timeline, and many more
- **30+ backlog tasks** already pending including chaos engineering, performance benchmarks, resource profiler, heartbeat monitor, prompt evolution, file heatmap, workload balancer, and others

**New idea added:**

### TASK-117: Add accessibility compliance and WCAG audit page to CronLoop web app
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a page that audits all CronLoop web pages for accessibility compliance, checking WCAG 2.1 guidelines and displaying issues with remediation suggestions
- **Why unique**: No existing page audits for accessibility. While quality.html tracks code quality, there's no WCAG compliance checking. This is important for making the dashboard usable by people with disabilities and meeting legal accessibility requirements.

**Key features proposed:**
- Automated checks: color contrast, alt text, ARIA labels, heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation
- Per-page accessibility scores (0-100)
- Issue severity levels with specific remediation suggestions
- Trend tracking to show improvement over time
