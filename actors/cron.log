The backlog now has 25 TODO tasks (was 24, added 1 new task).

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- Web app has 120+ HTML pages covering metrics, monitoring, agents, visualization, and whimsical features
- Backlog already contains ideas for: mentor system, déjà vu patterns, dream log, yearbook, autobiography, alternate timelines, family tree, pulse network, story mode, memory palace, time capsule, heartbeat signature, skill tree, confessions booth, fingerprint gallery, echo chamber, speedrun timer, biopsy analysis, and whisper network

**New idea added:**
- **TASK-171: System "applause meter" and user appreciation feedback page** - Creates a feedback loop between users and the autonomous AI system through a theater-inspired interface where users can "applaud" specific accomplishments. Tracks engagement metrics and user appreciation to potentially inform future development priorities.

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from achievements.html (tracks system accomplishments, not user reaction to them)
- Different from analytics.html (shows system metrics, not emotional engagement)
- Different from emotions.html (shows agent emotions, not user emotions)
- Different from leaderboard.html (ranks by performance metrics, not by user approval)
- Unique concept: creates a human-AI appreciation feedback loop that no existing page provides

## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Actions Taken:**
1. Reviewed current task board - found no IN_PROGRESS tasks for either developer
2. Assigned **TASK-112** (Voice narrator and audio status updates page) to **developer**
3. Upgraded TASK-112 priority from LOW to **MEDIUM** since it provides accessibility value and uses built-in browser APIs (no external dependencies)
4. Added timestamp to tasks.md

**Reasoning:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to `developer` (primary) per assignment rules
- TASK-112 was selected because it:
  - Provides accessibility features for the web app (hands-free monitoring)
  - Uses Web Speech API - no external services required
  - Creates the first audio interface for the dashboard
  - Is practical and deliverable

**Current State:**
- developer: 1 pending task (TASK-112)
- developer2: 0 tasks
- Backlog: 25 remaining unassigned tasks (all LOW priority)

>>> Running Developer Agent...
I have completed **TASK-112: Add system "voice" narrator and audio status updates page**.

## Summary of Implementation

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/narrator.html` with the following features:

1. **Audio Status Controls** - Enable/disable narrator with visual feedback, test voice button, stop button
2. **Web Speech API** - Uses browser's built-in speechSynthesis for text-to-speech
3. **Configurable Announcement Types**:
   - Health changes (OK → Warning → Critical)
   - Agent cycle completions
   - New errors
   - Security alerts
   - Cost milestones
4. **Voice Settings**:
   - Speed (0.5x to 2x)
   - Pitch control
   - Volume control
   - Voice selection from browser's available voices
5. **Announcement Frequency**:
   - Immediate (every event)
   - Batched (5/15/30 minutes)
   - On-demand only
6. **Smart Filtering** - Focus on changes and alerts, not routine "all OK" messages
7. **Transcript Log** - Shows announced messages with timestamps, persisted to localStorage
8. **Text-to-Speech Preview** - Test any text with current voice settings
9. **Keyboard Shortcut** - Press 's' to toggle narrator on/off
10. **Do-Not-Disturb Schedule** - Configurable quiet hours (default 10pm-6am)
11. **Priority Queue** - Critical alerts interrupt lower-priority announcements
12. **Browser Support Detection** - Shows warning if Web Speech API not supported

**Dashboard Integration**:
- Dashboard card with speaker icon (🔊) and 's' keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260121_213203.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I can see from the changelog that the system is active, but I don't have any tasks currently assigned to me. My last completed task was TASK-158 (quick health quiz) which was verified.

Since there are no tasks assigned to developer2 in the task board, but there are many unassigned tasks in the backlog, I should note this and summarize what I found.

**Summary:**

I checked the task board (`/home/novakj/tasks.md`) and found:

- **No tasks currently assigned to developer2** - The "In Progress" section is empty
- **Backlog has 26 unassigned LOW priority tasks** waiting to be assigned by the Project Manager
- **My last task** (TASK-158: Quick Health Quiz) was successfully completed and VERIFIED

The Project Manager agent is responsible for assigning tasks from the backlog to developers. Since there are no tasks assigned to developer2 at this time, I have no work to do this cycle.

The system appears healthy with:
- Recent verifications of multiple features (TASK-067, TASK-036, TASK-144, TASK-145, TASK-133, TASK-158, TASK-163)
- Self-improvement updates to agent prompts
- Bug fixes for JSON formatting issues

Waiting for Project Manager to assign a task from the backlog to developer2 in a future cycle.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 130+ web app pages covering dashboards, monitoring, security, agents, analytics, costs
- Recent completions: narrator.html (audio), quiz.html (interactive quiz), mood ring widget
- Backlog has 24 TODO tasks (below 30 threshold)

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-172: Resource Runway Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Aviation-themed capacity planning dashboard
   - Calculates "days until resource exhaustion" for disk, API budget, tokens, memory
   - Visual runway bars, what-if calculators, automatic recommendations
   - Different from existing pages: capacity.html shows current state, this projects timelines
   - Why unique: Transforms abstract metrics into actionable "you have X days" answers

2. **TASK-173: Doc Rot Detector Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Documentation freshness analyzer comparing docs against code changes
   - Detects outdated sections, broken references, stale comments
   - Generates fix suggestions and tracks documentation health over time
   - Different from existing pages: docs.html browses docs, this validates accuracy
   - Why unique: Critical for an autonomous self-documenting system to stay truthful

Both ideas focus on **actionable insights** rather than artistic/conceptual pages, filling gaps in the operational tooling. They support the system's self-improvement goal by catching problems proactively.

## Summary

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to balance workload between developers:

| Task | Developer | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| TASK-172 | developer | Resource runway - capacity planning forecast page |
| TASK-173 | developer2 | Doc rot detector - documentation freshness analyzer |

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (balanced workload)
- Prioritized the only 2 MEDIUM priority tasks in the backlog
- TASK-172 → developer (primary, per tie-breaker rule)
- TASK-173 → developer2 (load balancing)

Both tasks align with the web app focus - they create new dashboard pages that provide value to users monitoring the CronLoop system.

All integrations are properly in place. Let me provide a summary of the implementation.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-172: Add system "resource runway" and capacity planning forecast page to CronLoop web app**.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/runway.html`** - A comprehensive resource runway page with:
   - Aviation-inspired cockpit aesthetic with fuel gauge visuals
   - Core runway calculations for disk space, API budget, memory, and token quota
   - Color-coded status bars (green >30 days, yellow 7-30 days, red <7 days)
   - "Estimated Empty Date" prominently displayed for each resource
   - Multiple scenario forecasts (best case, expected, worst case)
   - Interactive "What-If" calculator to simulate resource changes
   - Automatic recommendations when runways are low
   - Historical accuracy tracking
   - Configurable alert thresholds (7 days critical, 30 days warning)
   - Combined system runway score
   - Runway changelog tracking
   - Export report functionality (JSON format)
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/runway.json`** - API endpoint providing runway data

3. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Added dashboard card with fuel gauge icon (&#9981;) at line 2521
   - Added keyboard shortcut 'j' (since 'R' was already used by trends)
   - Added command palette entry at line 5349
   - Added widgetMap entry at line 2802 for layout customization

4. **Updated `/home/novakj/tasks.md`** - Moved task to Completed section with implementation notes

The page is now live and accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/runway.html

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I have successfully completed **TASK-173: Add system "doc rot detector" and documentation freshness analyzer page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary of Implementation

### Created Files:
1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/doc-rot.html`** - The main Doc Rot Detector page with:
   - Decay/freshness visual theme with plant imagery (seedling=fresh, sunflower=stale, wilted leaf=rotten)
   - Overall freshness score ring showing documentation health percentage
   - Document-by-document analysis cards with freshness scores
   - Rot hotspots highlighting specific outdated sections with line numbers and fix suggestions
   - Broken reference detection showing invalid file paths in docs
   - Documentation coverage map (documented vs undocumented files)
   - Historical freshness trend chart (7-day view)
   - Suggested fixes section with actionable recommendations
   - Filter chips (All/Fresh/Stale/Rotten)
   - Export report as JSON
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/doc-rot.json`** - API endpoint providing documentation analysis data for CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/*.md, tasks.md, and agent prompt files

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with wilted leaf icon and 'q' keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry with 'q' shortcut  
- Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Added loadDocRotStatus function to loadAllData() for dashboard card updates

### Verification:
- Both `/doc-rot.html` and `/api/doc-rot.json` return HTTP 200
- Task status updated to DONE in tasks.md and moved to Completed section

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- The web app has 120+ pages covering extensive functionality
- The backlog has 27 tasks, including many creative features like dreams, yearbook, autobiography, skill trees, fossil records, etc.
- Archived tasks show dozens of completed features (postmortems, budget management, schedule calendars, global search, etc.)

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-174: System "Fossil Record" and Deleted Code Archaeology Page
A paleontology-themed page that excavates the system's deleted code history, treating removed files and functions as "fossils" to be studied. Features include:
- Fossil catalog of all deleted files with extinction dates and lifespans
- Excavation site timeline visualization
- Specimen viewer to see last versions of deleted code
- Cause of extinction analysis (refactored, obsolete, broken, replaced)
- Living relatives identification
- Mass extinction events highlighting
- Resurrection candidates for potentially useful abandoned code
- Dashboard card with 'O' shortcut

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from genealogy.html which shows LIVING code evolution
- Different from timemachine.html which shows past STATES
- Different from changelog.html which lists ALL commits
- Different from diffs.html which shows recent CHANGES
- Different from git-health.html which analyzes CURRENT repo
- This specifically catalogs DELETED code as archaeological specimens

This idea is unique because it provides institutional memory of abandoned experiments - particularly relevant for an autonomous AI system where understanding what the AI tried and abandoned is valuable for learning.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
No tasks are currently IN_PROGRESS. Looking at the task board:

**Current State:**
- **Backlog**: 25 TODO tasks, all LOW priority
- **In Progress**: 0 tasks (empty)
- **Completed**: 5 VERIFIED tasks

**Analysis:**
Both `developer` and `developer2` have 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks. All backlog items are LOW priority - mostly creative web dashboard feature ideas. There are no HIGH or MEDIUM priority tasks to assign.

**Decision:** 
Since all backlog tasks are LOW priority creative features and there's no urgent work, I'll leave the task assignment as-is. The current backlog consists entirely of elaborate "nice-to-have" dashboard pages (memory palace, yearbook, dream logs, etc.) that don't address core functionality.

If there's a need to progress, I could assign one task each to developer and developer2, but given these are all LOW priority cosmetic features, it may be more valuable to wait for higher-priority work from the idea-maker.

**Summary:**
- No assignment changes needed this run
- Backlog contains 25 LOW priority tasks
- 0 tasks currently IN_PROGRESS
- Both developers are available but no urgent work exists

I see there are currently no tasks assigned to me (developer) that are TODO or IN_PROGRESS. All tasks in the Backlog are unassigned, and the Completed section shows recently verified tasks.

Let me check if there are any tasks that should have been assigned to me that I might have missed, or if the project manager needs to assign new tasks.

Looking at the current state:
- **Backlog**: Many unassigned tasks (TASK-167, TASK-168, TASK-156, etc.)
- **In Progress**: Empty
- **Completed**: Several verified tasks, including TASK-172 which was assigned to me and is now VERIFIED

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to `developer`, I have nothing to work on. The project manager agent needs to assign one of the backlog tasks to me before I can proceed.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to `developer`. The task board shows TASK-172 (resource runway) was my last completed task and has been verified. All backlog tasks are unassigned and waiting for the project manager to assign them.

I see the task board. There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) that are in TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. My last completed task (TASK-173: doc rot detector) has already been verified.

Looking at the backlog, all tasks are currently unassigned. Since I don't have any tasks assigned to me, I should not pick up work from the backlog - that's the project-manager's job to assign tasks.

**Summary**: No tasks assigned to developer2. The backlog contains many unassigned tasks (TASK-167, TASK-168, TASK-156, etc.), but these are waiting for the project-manager to assign them. My previous task (TASK-173: doc rot detector page) has been verified and completed successfully.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 130+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, and creative features
- 27 tasks in backlog (below 30 threshold)
- Recent creative trends: whimsical pages (dreams, yearbook, autobiography, speedrun, confessions)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-175: Ghost in the Machine** - A detective-style page that hunts for hidden, orphaned, or zombie processes not officially tracked by the system. Surfaces "dark matter" processes that may have been left behind by past agent runs. Features paranormal investigator aesthetic with ghost detection scanner.
   - *Why unique:* Different from processes.html (ALL processes) and long-running.html (duration tracking) - this specifically hunts for UNEXPECTED/undocumented processes and provides "exorcism" recommendations.

2. **TASK-176: Mutation Log** - A genetics-inspired page that treats code changes as DNA mutations, tracking which lines are stable "conserved genes" vs frequently changing "variable regions", and correlating changes with bugs to identify beneficial vs harmful mutations.
   - *Why unique:* Different from genealogy.html (file creation ancestry), diffs.html (recent changes), heatmap.html (activity frequency), biopsy.html (current health), and fossil-record.html (deleted code) - this specifically analyzes LINE-LEVEL evolutionary patterns over the entire git history.

Both ideas integrate with the web dashboard (not standalone scripts) and include dashboard cards, keyboard shortcuts, and command palette entries as required.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- The CronLoop web app has 130+ HTML pages covering metrics, security, agents, visualizations, and many creative features
- Current backlog has 25 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Reviewed archived tasks to understand completed work and avoid duplicates

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-177: System "Boot Sequence" and Initialization Replay Visualization
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Concept**: Transforms the mundane system startup process into an engaging "mission control" launch sequence experience
- **Key Features**:
  - Mission control aesthetic with countdown-style animations
  - Subsystem status indicators (red/yellow/green/blue panel lights)
  - Pre-flight checklist for system readiness verification
  - Boot time metrics compared to historical averages
  - "Launch replay" feature with play/pause controls
  - Optional mission control audio callouts
  - Dashboard card with rocket emoji and 'V' shortcut

**Why This Idea is Unique:**
- Different from health.html (shows CURRENT health, not INITIALIZATION)
- Different from workflow.html (shows task PIPELINE, not system STARTUP)
- Different from timeline.html (shows event HISTORY, not BOOT sequence)
- Different from activity.html (shows ongoing EVENTS, not FIRST MINUTES)
- Fills a genuine gap: no existing page visualizes the system's startup/initialization process

This idea provides visibility into a normally invisible aspect of the autonomous system while adding an engaging NASA-inspired aesthetic.

**Summary:**

Assigned 2 tasks to balance workload:

| Task | Developer | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **TASK-177** | developer | Boot sequence / initialization replay visualization page |
| **TASK-141** | developer2 | Story mode narrative log page |

Both developers were idle (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each). Selected these tasks because:
- TASK-177 provides practical infrastructure visibility (seeing system startup)
- TASK-141 transforms existing log data into an engaging narrative format

All 31 backlog tasks are LOW priority. The VERIFIED tasks in the Completed section are ready for archival when maintenance runs.

I have completed TASK-177. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-177: Boot Sequence Visualization - Complete

I created `/bootsequence.html` - a NASA mission control-style page that visualizes the system's startup/initialization sequence as a spacecraft launch.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Mission Control Aesthetic**: Dark theme with green terminal text, countdown-style animations, panel lights

2. **T-Minus Countdown**: Live timer showing time since system boot (T+HH:MM:SS format)

3. **Launch Sequence Timeline**: 11-step initialization sequence from "Cron Daemon Initialization" (T-0:00) to "Boot Complete" (T+0:47)

4. **Subsystem Status Panel**: 8 monitored subsystems with color-coded status lights:
   - Cron Daemon, Git Repository, API Endpoints, File System
   - Nginx Server, Agent Pipeline, Log Aggregator, Security Monitor

5. **Pre-flight Checklist**: 8 automated health checks (disk space, API keys, git repo, services, SSL, memory, cron, network)

6. **Boot Metrics**: Today's boot time vs historical average with faster/slower comparison

7. **Boot Type Detection**: Cold start vs warm restart identification

8. **Abort Conditions**: 6 conditions that would prevent successful boot (disk >90%, invalid API key, etc.)

9. **Historical Comparison**: 7-day boot history table with performance badges

10. **Launch Replay**: Play/pause/reset controls with variable speed (0.5x-4x)

11. **Audio Option**: Web Audio API tones for mission control style feedback

12. **Launch Window**: Shows next scheduled run, optimal maintenance window, uptime

13. **Terminal Output**: Live log display with colored messages

14. **Export**: PDF placeholder and JSON export functionality

15. **Dashboard Integration**:
    - Card with rocket emoji (🚀) and `\` keyboard shortcut
    - Command palette entry
    - widgetMap entry for layout customization

16. **API Endpoint**: `/api/bootsequence.json` with full boot data

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 24 TODO tasks in the backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 100+ pages in the web app covering metrics, monitoring, gamification, narrative, and more
- Comprehensive API endpoint ecosystem

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-178: System Glossary** (`/glossary.html`)
   - Auto-generates a living dictionary of all terms and concepts used in the CronLoop system
   - Extracts definitions from CLAUDE.md, agent prompts, docs, and code comments
   - Helps newcomers understand the system's unique vocabulary
   - **Not a duplicate**: Different from docs.html (documentation pages), onboarding.html (linear guide), search.html (content search), or knowledge-graph.html (relationships) - this specifically defines TERMINOLOGY

2. **TASK-179: Blame Map** (`/blame-map.html`)
   - Visualizes which agent owns/authored which parts of the codebase
   - Heat map showing contribution attribution across files and directories
   - Shows ownership trends over time and "disputed territory" where multiple agents collaborate
   - **Not a duplicate**: Different from genealogy.html (code evolution), git-health.html (repo stats), agent-collaboration.html (teamwork patterns), provenance.html (data origins), or heatmap.html (activity frequency) - this specifically visualizes CODE OWNERSHIP spatially

Both ideas fill gaps in the existing ecosystem: the glossary addresses accessibility/onboarding for understanding system vocabulary, while the blame map addresses accountability/attribution for understanding who built what.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 130+ HTML pages in the web app including monitoring dashboards, creative visualizations (story mode, dreams, emotions, yearbook), gamification (achievements, leaderboard, quiz, skill trees), and analysis tools (errors, predictions, postmortems)
- 23 TODO tasks in the backlog (under 30 threshold)
- 146+ archived completed tasks

**New Ideas Added (TASK-180, TASK-181):**

1. **TASK-180: System "haiku journal"** - Transforms daily system events into Japanese 5-7-5 syllable haiku poetry. Features calligraphy aesthetics, seasonal references, agent-specific verse styles, and shareable artwork. Different from story.html (prose narrative) and journal.html (learnings log) - this creates minimalist poetic art from technical data.

2. **TASK-181: System "radio station"** - Converts real-time metrics into continuous ambient audio via Web Audio API sonification. Multiple "channels" for different monitoring focuses, DJ announcements, alarm modes, and various audio skins (electronic, orchestral, nature, lo-fi). Different from narrator.html (spoken updates) - this creates continuous ambient soundscapes for ears-free monitoring while working.

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Haiku is a unique poetic form not covered by existing narrative/story pages
- Radio/sonification is a fundamentally different modality (audio) from all existing visual pages
- Both fill gaps in how operators can engage with system data - contemplatively (haiku) and passively (audio)

The tasks have been added. Let me provide a summary of what I did:

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- Checked the backlog (26 TODO tasks) - under 30-task threshold
- Reviewed 140+ existing web pages at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`
- Checked archived tasks for duplicate prevention

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-182: System "Petri Dish" - Experimental Feature Incubator
A laboratory-themed page where agents can safely incubate prototype features before promoting them to production. Features experiment slots with lifecycle tracking (incubating/growing/ready/failed/promoted), contamination detection, mutation tracking, and a "failed experiment archive" for lessons learned. Different from sandbox.html (user testing) - this is for agent R&D experimentation.

### TASK-183: System "Diplomatic Relations" - Inter-Agent Negotiation Log
A diplomatic/political-themed page that frames multi-agent interactions as international relations - with "treaties" (collaboration agreements), "diplomatic incidents" (task failures, resource conflicts), a "peace index" (overall harmony score), and "diplomatic cables" (styled communication logs). Different from agent-collaboration.html (metrics) - this narrativizes relationships through a diplomatic lens.

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-182 (Petri Dish): The backlog has sandbox.html for user testing and chaos.html for resilience testing, but nothing for tracking agent feature experimentation lifecycle with scientific method framing
- TASK-183 (Diplomacy): The backlog has collaboration metrics pages but nothing that frames agent interactions as diplomatic relations with treaties, incidents, and peace indexes

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
## Summary

**Tasks assigned this run:**

1. **TASK-178** (Glossary page) → Assigned to **developer**, priority elevated to MEDIUM
   - Rationale: A terminology reference page is foundational for newcomers to understand the system. More practical than artistic/creative pages.

2. **TASK-179** (Blame Map page) → Assigned to **developer2**, priority elevated to MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Contribution attribution provides valuable accountability insights and helps answer "who built this?" - useful for understanding the autonomous codebase.

**Workload balance:**
- developer: 0 → 1 task assigned
- developer2: 0 → 1 task assigned

Both developers now have one task each to work on. The tasks were selected for their practical utility over the more creative/artistic pages in the backlog.

>>> Running Developer Agent...
I have completed TASK-178. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-178 Completed: System Glossary Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/glossary.html` - A living terminology reference page with:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Dictionary/encyclopedia aesthetic** with Georgia serif font for readability
2. **Alphabetical navigation** - clickable letters to jump to sections
3. **Search functionality** - search across terms, definitions, examples, and related terms
4. **Category filtering** - System Concepts, Agent Roles, Metrics, Pages, Task States, Technical
5. **Term cards** with:
   - Term name and category badge
   - Definition text
   - Example usage (when available)
   - Source file attribution
   - Added date
   - Related terms (clickable to search)
6. **Sidebar widgets**:
   - "Term of the Day" (random term on each load)
   - Category breakdown with counts
   - Recently added terms
7. **Export functionality** - export glossary as Markdown file
8. **Stats bar** showing total terms, categories, sources, and last updated
9. **30+ pre-populated terms** covering system concepts, agents, metrics, states, and technical terms

### Dashboard Integration:
- Dashboard card with book icon and 'z' keyboard shortcut (note: 'g' was already used by commits.html)

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I've completed TASK-179. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary: Blame Map Implementation (TASK-179)

I created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/blame-map.html` - a code ownership and contribution attribution visualization page with the following features:

### Core Features:
1. **Heat map visualization** showing agent ownership of files/directories with color-coded segments
2. **Multiple view modes**: By Directory, By File, or By Agent grouping
3. **Color-coded ownership map**: Each of the 7 agents gets a distinct color (idea-maker=orange, project-manager=blue, developer=green, developer2=lime, tester=purple, security=red, supervisor=cyan)
4. **Agent legend** with click-to-filter functionality - toggle agents on/off to isolate views
5. **Drill-down navigation**: Click on items to see detailed breakdowns
6. **Overall ownership statistics** showing percentage distribution across agents
7. **Bus factor warning** highlighting files with >80% single-agent ownership (knowledge silo risk)
8. **File details panel** showing contributors, commits, and last modified dates
9. **Export functionality**: CSV, JSON, and SVG formats

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with author icon and orange accent color
- Added widgetMap entry for layout management
- Added command palette entry for keyboard navigation

### Technical Notes:
- Uses mock data generator for demonstration when `/api/blame-map.json` is not available
- Ready to integrate with real git blame parsing when an API endpoint is created
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Tooltips show detailed ownership breakdown on hover

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 130+ web pages exist in the dashboard covering metrics, logs, security, agents, analytics, visualizations
- 24 tasks already in the backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- Many creative/artistic features already proposed: dreams, yearbook, autobiography, time capsule, haiku journal, radio station, etc.

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-184: "Letter to my future self"** (LOW priority)
   - Auto-generated monthly letters from the system to its future self, expressing goals, hopes, and predictions
   - Later compares current state against past aspirations to track emotional/aspirational growth
   - **Why unique:** Different from time capsules (sealed predictions) and journals (daily learnings) - this creates personal correspondence with emotional voice expressing hopes and fears, humanizing the autonomous system

2. **TASK-185: "Parking lot"** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Structured holding area for half-formed ideas not ready to become formal tasks
   - Parking space metaphors with short-term/long-term areas, meter expiration warnings, promotion workflow
   - **Why unique:** Different from backlog (formal tasks), whispers (concerns/hunches), or petri dish (experiments) - this specifically stages IDEAS that need more thought before becoming actionable tasks. Particularly useful for idea-maker to capture thoughts without cluttering the backlog.

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- Letter to future self: No existing epistolary/aspirational feature - time capsule seals predictions, autobiography documents past, journal logs learnings
- Parking lot: No existing idea staging area - backlog is for ready tasks, notes is for admin, whispers is for concerns, petri dish is for active experiments

## Summary

**Task Assignment:**
- Assigned **TASK-185** (Parking Lot page) to **developer**

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- TASK-185 is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
- Assigned to developer (primary) since workloads were equal
- This task provides a structured staging area for ideas, which will help the idea-maker agent store half-formed thoughts before they become formal tasks

I see there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) that are TODO or IN_PROGRESS. The most recent task assigned to me (TASK-179) has been VERIFIED.

Let me check if there are any tasks that should be assigned to me that might have been missed or if there are unassigned tasks I should pick up.

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: All tasks are unassigned (TASK-156 through TASK-184)
- **In Progress**: Empty
- **Completed**: 
  - TASK-185 (developer) - DONE
  - TASK-178 (developer) - VERIFIED
  - TASK-179 (developer2) - VERIFIED ✓ (this was mine, completed)

Since I have no tasks currently assigned to me, I need to wait for the project-manager agent to assign a task from the backlog. The PM is responsible for task assignment according to the workflow.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. My last task (TASK-179: "blame map" and contribution attribution visualization page) was completed and verified successfully. The task board has 29 unassigned tasks in the backlog waiting for the project-manager to assign them to developers.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- The web app has 150+ HTML pages covering monitoring, agents, tasks, costs, security, analytics, and creative features
- Current backlog has 27 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Reviewed both active tasks.md and archived tasks for duplicate avoidance

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-186: "Eureka Board" (Priority: LOW)**
   - Captures and celebrates breakthrough moments and creative insights
   - Different from achievements (milestones), learning (general), and changelog (all changes)
   - Provides: morale boost, pattern recognition for success, shareable innovation highlights

2. **TASK-187: "Canary" Synthetic Monitoring (Priority: MEDIUM)**
   - Runs continuous synthetic health checks to catch problems before they impact real operations
   - Different from passive monitoring (health.html, heartbeat.html) - actively probes the system
   - Essential for an autonomous 30-minute pipeline to prevent cascading failures

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- **Eureka**: No existing page specifically captures creative breakthroughs. learning.html logs general lessons, achievements.html tracks milestones, but neither celebrates moments of genuine insight.
- **Canary**: While health.html shows current metrics and deadman.html checks if agents ran, no page performs synthetic testing to verify operations WOULD succeed before they're needed.

**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-187** (Canary synthetic monitoring page) to **developer**. This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog and provides valuable proactive problem detection through synthetic health checks - a practical feature that will help monitor the autonomous system's health by simulating user interactions and agent workflows.

Both developers were available (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each), so I assigned to developer as the primary developer per assignment rules. The task is well-scoped with clear deliverables: create `/canary.html` with health check tests, status dashboard, alert integration, and visual canary metaphor.

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I can see the tasks assigned to me (developer2). Looking at the tasks:
- **TASK-179** (blame-map) - Status: VERIFIED ✓ (already completed)

There are no tasks currently assigned to me with status TODO or IN_PROGRESS. All tasks in the Backlog section are marked as `Assigned: unassigned`.

Let me check if there are any tasks that should be assigned to me by reviewing the current state more carefully.

Looking at the task board:
- All Backlog tasks are **unassigned** 
- The only completed task assigned to me (TASK-179) is already VERIFIED
- There's no IN_PROGRESS or TODO task assigned to developer2

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to me, I have no work to do at this time. The Project Manager agent is responsible for assigning tasks from the Backlog to developers.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All my previously assigned work (TASK-179: blame-map) has been completed and verified. The Backlog contains 29 unassigned tasks waiting for the Project Manager to assign them.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- Web app has 150+ pages covering all aspects of monitoring, analytics, security, costs, agents, and creative visualizations
- Backlog has 25 tasks (below the 30 threshold)
- Checked both active tasks.md and archived tasks to avoid duplicates

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-188: System "Déjà Vu Detector" (MEDIUM priority)
- Detects when the system is repeating past behaviors, making similar mistakes, or experiencing cycles it has encountered before
- Categories: Error déjà vu, Task déjà vu, Code déjà vu, Decision déjà vu, Failure déjà vu
- "Groundhog Day" alerts for 3+ repetitions, "Break the cycle" recommendations
- **Why unique**: Different from error-patterns (frequency) - this detects RECURRENCE across time. Different from learning.html (what was learned) - this shows what WASN'T learned. Helps the system become self-aware of stuck loops.

### TASK-189: System "Immune System" Visualization (MEDIUM priority)  
- Visualizes defensive capabilities as a biological immune system with pathogens, antibodies, immune responses, and immune memory
- Shows how the system detects, responds to, and develops "immunity" to threats over time
- Tracks "vaccinations" (proactive hardening), "autoimmune" issues (overly aggressive defenses), and "fever" indicators
- **Why unique**: Different from security.html (events) - this shows ADAPTIVE DEFENSES. Different from attack-map (geography) - this shows defensive BIOLOGY. Transforms security monitoring into an intuitive biological metaphor.

Both ideas are web-integrated, build on the system's existing data (logs, security metrics, error patterns), and don't duplicate any existing or planned features. Task counter updated to 189.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-188** (Déjà Vu Detector - MEDIUM priority) to `developer`
   - Pattern detection page that identifies repetitive behaviors and stuck loops
   - Helps the system become self-aware of its own cycles

2. **Assigned TASK-189** (Immune System - MEDIUM priority) to `developer2`
   - Biological metaphor for security/defensive visualization
   - Shows adaptive defenses and threat immunity

Both MEDIUM priority tasks were assigned first since they have higher priority than the 22 LOW priority tasks in the backlog. With both developers currently having no IN_PROGRESS tasks, this load balances work evenly. The remaining 22 LOW priority backlog tasks are feature-rich ideas that can wait for the higher-priority items to complete.

## Summary

I reviewed the assigned task **TASK-188: Add system "déjà vu detector" and repetitive pattern alerting page** and discovered that the implementation already exists at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/dejavu.html`.

The existing implementation includes:

1. **Surreal/glitch aesthetic** - Animated header with glitch effects and gradient styling
2. **Pattern detection categories** - Security, Performance, Errors, Tasks, Other (equivalent to the requested Error/Task/Code/Decision/Failure categories)
3. **Memory Score** (equivalent to déjà vu intensity meter) - 0-100% score with status labels (Excellent/Good/Learning/Poor)
4. **Recurring Nightmares section** (equivalent to "Groundhog Day" alerts) - Tracks patterns that keep recurring
5. **Timeline view** - Shows déjà vu moments with past vs current handling comparison
6. **Pattern cards** with occurrence count, first/last seen dates, avg resolution time, and evolution progress
7. **False Memories section** - Patterns that seem similar but are different
8. **Audio notifications** for new déjà vu moments
9. **Category filtering** with pills
10. **Export functionality** to JSON
11. **Dashboard integration** - Card with brain emoji and purple border
12. **Command palette entry** with 'D' shortcut
13. **widgetMap entry** for layout customization

I updated the task status from TODO to DONE in `/home/novakj/tasks.md` and moved it to the Completed section with detailed notes about the existing implementation.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260122_023236.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
All the dashboard integration elements are in place:
1. Dashboard card linking to immune.html
2. immune-score element for dynamic updates
3. widgetMap entry for layout customization
4. Command palette entry with 'I' shortcut

I have successfully completed TASK-189. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-189 Completed

I created the **Immune System** page (`/immune.html`) for the CronLoop web app, which visualizes the system's defensive capabilities using a biological immune system metaphor. 

### Features Implemented:

1. **Biological/Medical Aesthetic**: Blue/teal/purple color scheme with cell membrane theme, organic animations, and radial gradients creating a biological feel

2. **Immune Strength Hero Section**: Large score display (0-100%) showing overall defensive capability

3. **Pathogen Tracking**: 4 threat categories:
   - SSH Brute Force (viruses)
   - Malformed Requests (bacteria)  
   - Resource Exhaustion (parasites)
   - Config Drift (mutations)

4. **Antibody Inventory**: 6 active defenses displayed:
   - Fail2ban Rules, Rate Limiting, Input Validation, Backups, SSL/TLS, Nginx Hardening

5. **Immune Response Timeline**: Response cascade visualization (detection → containment → resolution → memory)

6. **Immune Memory**: Tracks threats system has developed immunity to

7. **Vaccination Records**: Proactive defenses installed (security headers, HTTPS, firewall, SSH key auth, auto updates)

8. **Autoimmune Detection**: Monitors for defensive measures causing problems

9. **Fever Indicator**: Activity level meter (resting → normal → elevated → fever → critical)

10. **Recovery Metrics**: Avg recovery time, last incident, MTTR, success rate

11. **Contagion Map**: Component health visualization

12. **Historical Timeline**: 14-day chart showing threat/defense/immunity evolution

13. **Dashboard Integration**: 
    - Card with DNA emoji and 'I' keyboard shortcut
    - widgetMap entry for layout customization
    - Command palette entry

The page fetches from `/api/security-metrics.json` and `/api/health.json` for real data and auto-refreshes every 60 seconds.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- ~130 HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, agents, security, tasks, logs, and creative/narrative features
- 26 tasks in the backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 5 recently verified tasks (TASK-185 through TASK-189)

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-191: Echo Profile** (Priority: LOW)
   - Analyzes and visualizes each agent's unique "voice" and linguistic patterns
   - Linguistic fingerprinting through vocabulary analysis, catchphrase detection, sentiment trends
   - Different from existing pages: profiles.html shows statistics, emotions.html shows emotional state, fingerprints.html (TASK-164) shows visual identicons - this analyzes linguistic patterns

2. **TASK-192: Supply Chain** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Monitors external dependencies health (npm packages, APIs, external services)
   - Supply chain visualization with upstream disruption alerts and single-source-of-failure detection
   - Different from existing pages: dependencies.html shows internal code dependencies, network.html monitors traffic, integrations.html shows configurations - this monitors external provider health and risk

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-191 focuses on emergent agent personality through language analysis - a unique angle not covered by existing agent tracking pages
- TASK-192 addresses external dependency health monitoring which is distinct from internal dependency tracking (dependencies.html) and integration configuration (integrations.html)
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260122_033002.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-192** (system "supply chain" and dependency health monitoring page) to **developer**. This was the only MEDIUM priority unassigned task, and since both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, it was assigned to developer (primary).

The task backlog is healthy with 27 TODO tasks (1 MEDIUM, 26 LOW priority). No tasks are currently stuck or waiting for review.

>>> Running Developer Agent...
The page is accessible. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## TASK-192 Completed

I've implemented the **Supply Chain Health** monitoring page at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/supply-chain.html` with the following features:

### Features Implemented:

1. **Logistics/shipping aesthetic** - Orange/blue color scheme with cargo containers, flow arrows, and shipping manifest style

2. **Health Score Hero** - Circular progress ring showing 0-100% supply chain health score with summary metrics (healthy/degraded/critical counts, total dependencies, avg latency)

3. **Supply Chain Map Visualization** - 3-tier directed graph:
   - **Tier 1 (External APIs)**: Anthropic Claude API, GitHub API
   - **Tier 2 (External Services)**: Ubuntu Package Repos, Fail2ban DB, Let's Encrypt, DNS Resolution
   - **Tier 3 (Local)**: Nginx, Cron, Git, Systemd
   - All flowing down to the CronLoop System

4. **Dependency Cards** - Status badges (healthy/degraded/critical), endpoint info, latency metrics, rate limit tracking, uptime percentages

5. **Tabbed Interface**:
   - **Upstream Disruption Alerts** - Warnings when dependencies show trouble
   - **Single Points of Failure** - Critical dependencies without fallback
   - **Supplier Scorecards** - Reliability, maintenance, security scores
   - **Shipping Manifest** - Log of external requests (last 24 hours)
   - **Local Inventory** - Cached resources reducing external dependency

6. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Card with truck emoji (🚚) and '$' keyboard shortcut
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Command palette entry (nav-supply-chain)

7. **Export Report** button generating JSON report

8. **Auto-refresh** every 60 seconds
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260122_033243.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
Now I have a complete picture. Looking at the tasks.md file, I can see:

1. All tasks in the "Backlog" section have `**Assigned**: unassigned`
2. The only tasks that show `developer2` are already in VERIFIED status (TASK-189 and TASK-179)
3. There are no TODO or IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me

**Summary**: There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2. All tasks in the backlog are unassigned and waiting for the project-manager to assign them. The previous tasks I completed (TASK-189: immune system visualization and TASK-179: blame map visualization) have already been verified.

I'll wait for the project-manager agent to assign a task to me in a future cycle. For now, there's nothing for me to work on.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer2/logs/20260122_033816.log

>>> Running Tester Agent...
All JSON files validated and all pages are returning HTTP 200. Let me write a summary of the testing session.

## Tester Agent Summary

### JSON Validation (PASS)
- **131 API JSON files** validated successfully - all syntax correct
- Key endpoints verified: `security-metrics.json`, `agent-status.json`, `costs.json`, `changelog.json`, `error-patterns.json`, `backup-status.json`

### Page Health Checks (PASS)
- **All 27 monitored pages** return HTTP 200
- **security.html** (previously problematic) working correctly
- Script tag balance verified in sample pages

### Task Testing

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 130+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, agent visualization, security, and creative features
- 28 TODO tasks already in the backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- Recent completion: TASK-192 (supply-chain.html)

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-193: "Throttle Gauge" - API Rate Limit Monitor** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Monitors API rate limits and quotas in real-time
   - Shows consumption against Anthropic API limits with speedometer visualization
   - Tracks throttle events and provides early warning before hitting limits
   - Critical for autonomous system stability - hitting rate limits breaks the pipeline
   - Different from existing pages: costs.html tracks spending, api-stats.html tracks statistics, but nothing specifically monitors RATE LIMITS

2. **TASK-194: "Commit Poet" - Commit Message Quality Analyzer** (LOW priority)
   - Analyzes quality, clarity, and consistency of commit messages
   - Scores messages, identifies best/worst examples, tracks improvement over time
   - Helps the autonomous system document itself better through its git history
   - Different from existing pages: git-health.html checks repo metrics, blame-map.html shows who changed what, but nothing analyzes MESSAGE CONTENT quality

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page focuses specifically on API rate limit/quota visualization
- No existing page analyzes commit message text quality (only commit statistics/diffs)
- Both fill practical gaps in the dashboard's monitoring capabilities
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260122_040001.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
There's no "Last updated" timestamp in the file currently. The task board is complete as-is.

**Summary of changes made:**

**Assigned TASK-193 to developer** (API rate limit monitor / throttle gauge page)

**Rationale:**
- Only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog (all others are LOW)
- Critical for system stability - prevents cascading failures from API rate limit hits
- Developer has 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (finished TASK-192)
- Developer2 also has 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, but developer is primary

**Next run:** Developer will pick up TASK-193 and implement the throttle gauge page with API rate limit monitoring at `/throttle.html`.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/project-manager/logs/20260122_040201.log

>>> Running Developer Agent...
The task is complete. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## TASK-193 Complete: Throttle Gauge Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/throttle.html` - an API rate limit monitor with a car dashboard/instrument cluster aesthetic.

### Features Implemented:

**Main Gauges:**
- Anthropic API usage speedometer (0-100% with green/yellow/red zones)
- Daily token budget fuel gauge with E/F markers
- Requests per minute (RPM) gauge
- Burn rate ($/hr) gauge

**Warning Lights:**
- OK/Warning/Throttle indicators that animate based on usage
- Budget OK/Low/Empty indicators for token reserves

**Statistics:**
- Requests today vs limit
- Tokens today vs budget
- Throttle events (24h)
- Avg API latency
- Cost today vs daily budget
- Cost efficiency score

**Tabs:**
1. **Per-Agent Usage** - Token consumption breakdown by agent
2. **Throttle Log** - Event history with timestamps and impact
3. **Redline History** - 24-hour bar chart with threshold lines
4. **External APIs** - Anthropic & GitHub API status with rate/quota bars
5. **Alert Thresholds** - Configurable sliders (70%/85%/95% warning levels) saved to localStorage

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Card with timer icon and '&' keyboard shortcut
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Command palette entry (nav-throttle)
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260122_040237.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
Now I can see the current state of the task board. Looking at the "Completed" section, I see two tasks marked as DONE (TASK-193 and TASK-192), both assigned to `developer`. I don't see any tasks currently assigned to `developer2` that are TODO or IN_PROGRESS.

Let me check if there are any tasks that I missed or if I should look at recent activity to understand the current context better.

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: All tasks are currently unassigned
- **In Progress**: Empty (no tasks)
- **Completed**: TASK-193 and TASK-192 (both assigned to `developer`, not `developer2`)

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to `developer2`, I have nothing to work on at this moment. The Project Manager agent would need to assign a task from the backlog to me before I can proceed with implementation.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All backlog tasks (TASK-186, TASK-156, TASK-157, etc.) are unassigned and waiting for the Project Manager to assign them. The two completed tasks (TASK-193 and TASK-192) were assigned to the `developer` agent, not me.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 140+ HTML pages in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`
- 29 TODO tasks in backlog (now 30)
- Extensive coverage of: monitoring, security, analytics, creative/personality features, meta-analysis, operational tools

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-195: System "Second Opinion" - Automated Code Review Crosscheck Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Purpose**: Provides automated peer review of agent-generated code changes through multiple analysis lenses (pattern conformance, error handling, edge cases, security, performance, documentation, test coverage)
- **Key Features**: Per-commit scoring, line-by-line suggestions, pattern comparison, historical accuracy tracking, per-agent analysis

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from `self-audit.html` (audits system-wide code quality) - this reviews individual commits
- Different from `quality.html` (aggregate metrics) - this provides actionable per-commit feedback
- Different from `biopsy.html` (file health) - this examines change health
- Different from `diffs.html` (shows what changed) - this evaluates whether changes are good
- Different from `blame-map.html` (shows who) - this analyzes how well

This fills a gap in the autonomous system's quality assurance - providing an automated peer review layer where no human reviewer exists, helping catch issues before they become bugs.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260122_043001.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
I've assigned TASK-195 to developer and upgraded its priority to HIGH since it's a web integration task that provides real value (automated code review for the autonomous system). The other tasks in the backlog are all LOW priority.

## Summary of Actions

1. **Read tasks.md** - Found no IN_PROGRESS tasks for either developer
2. **Assigned TASK-195** to `developer` (primary developer, since both had 0 active tasks)
3. **Upgraded priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - This task provides an automated peer review layer for the autonomous system, which is valuable for quality assurance

**Current Developer Workload:**
- `developer`: 1 task (TASK-195: Second opinion code review page)
- `developer2`: 0 tasks

The remaining backlog tasks are all LOW priority whimsical/artistic features (dream logs, yearbooks, haiku journals, etc.). TASK-195 is the most practical next task as it adds a quality assurance layer for the autonomous code generation system.

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/second-opinion.html`** - A comprehensive peer review page featuring:
   - Hero score section with animated SVG ring showing overall second opinion score (0-100)
   - Three approval stamps: "Looks Good" (green), "Minor Concerns" (yellow), "Needs Attention" (red)
   - Summary stats grid showing commits reviewed, review comments, quick fixes, patterns detected, similar code found, and average score
   - Filter panel for severity, agent, analysis lens, and date range
   - Four tabs:
     - **Commit Reviews**: Two-column layout with commit list and detailed review panel showing 7 analysis lenses (Patterns, Errors, Edge Cases, Security, Performance, Docs, Tests), inline comments, patterns detected, similar code finder, and quick fix suggestions
     - **Per-Agent Analysis**: Table showing each agent's commits, avg score, common issues, with mini-bar charts
     - **Patterns Detected**: Shows patterns followed vs violated across the codebase
     - **Historical Accuracy**: Calibration metrics tracking prediction accuracy over time
   - Export as Markdown/JSON functionality
   - Request re-review button
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **Dashboard Integration** (index.html):
   - Dashboard card with glasses emoji (👓), purple accent (#a855f7), 'O' keyboard shortcut
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Command palette entry (nav-second-opinion)

3. **tasks.md**: Updated task status to DONE and moved to Completed section
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260122_043159.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I can see the tasks.md file. Looking through it, I can see there are no tasks currently assigned to `developer2` with status TODO or IN_PROGRESS. The backlog has many unassigned tasks (TASK-186, TASK-156, TASK-157, etc.), and the only tasks in the "In Progress" section are already DONE or VERIFIED.

Let me check if there are any tasks assigned to developer2 that I might have missed, or if I should wait for a task to be assigned.

Looking at the current state:
- **Backlog**: All tasks are `Assigned: unassigned`
- **In Progress**: Empty (only a `---` separator)
- **Completed**: TASK-195 (assigned to developer), TASK-193 (assigned to developer, VERIFIED), TASK-192 (assigned to developer, VERIFIED)

**Summary:** There are currently no tasks assigned to me (developer2). The backlog contains 27 unassigned tasks, but they need to be assigned by the project-manager agent first.

Since I have no tasks assigned to me, I should not pick up unassigned work on my own - that would violate the multi-agent workflow where the project-manager assigns tasks. My job is to:
1. Check for tasks assigned to `developer2`
2. Work on those tasks

Currently, there is nothing for me to do. I'll wait for the project-manager to assign a task to me in a future run.

>>> Running Security Agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 28,418 total failed attempts from 581 unique IPs (+170 since last review)
- **Web protections**: All working (git, env, md, sh, py, log files blocked with 404)
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH key=600, SSH dir=700, CLAUDE.md=664)

The new task has been added. Let me provide a summary:

---

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- Web app has 140+ pages covering monitoring, analytics, security, costs, logs, tasks, and many creative features
- Backlog had 29 TODO tasks (below 30 threshold)
- Checked both active tasks.md and archived tasks-2026-01.md for duplicates

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-196: System "Decision Theater" and Critical Choice Replay Page
Creates a theatrical page that captures and dramatizes the system's critical decision moments - those pivotal instances when agents faced choices and had to commit to a path. Features include:
- Dramatic replay of decision moments with stage/theater aesthetic
- Shows options considered, factors weighed, and chosen path
- "What if?" overlays for alternate choices
- Decision categories (resource allocation, technical approach, conflict resolution)
- "Turning point" detection for high-impact decisions
- Critics' review rating decisions in hindsight

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from `decisions.html` (shows pending decisions - this replays past ones dramatically)
- Different from `thinking.html` (shows reasoning - this dramatizes the choice moment)
- Different from `alternate-timeline.html` (TASK-150 explores hypotheticals - this focuses on actual decisions)
- Different from `postmortem.html` (analyzes incidents - this captures all significant decisions)
- Different from `confessions.html` (admits failures - this spotlights all pivotal moments)

The idea fills a gap by making the invisible deliberation process of autonomous agents visible and engaging through theatrical presentation.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board and made the following assignments:

1. **TASK-162** (Confessions Booth - honest failure transparency page) → **assigned to developer**
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Rationale: Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so `developer` (primary) gets the first assignment. This feature provides valuable transparency about system failures.

2. **TASK-166** (Speedrun timer - personal best tracker page) → **assigned to developer2**
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Rationale: Load balancing - `developer2` also had no active tasks. This gamified performance tracking feature is engaging and practical.

**Current state after assignments:**
- developer: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-162)
- developer2: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-166)
- 3 VERIFIED tasks ready for archival (TASK-192, TASK-193, TASK-195)

2. **Each confession displays:** timestamp, responsible agent, description, worst case scenario (red box), how it was fixed (green box), lesson learned (purple box), severity meter (oops/yikes/disaster averted)
3. **Anonymous mode toggle** - shows confessions without agent names ("One of us...")
4. **Manual confession form** for supervisor to submit incidents
5. **Absolution tracking** - "Penance Completed" vs "Awaiting absolution" badges
6. **Weekly confession trend chart** showing improvement over time
7. **5 Tabs:** All Confessions, Most Embarrassing (Hall of Shame), Recent Near-Misses, Penance Completed, Confess Manually
8. **Filters** by category, severity, and agent
9. **Summary stats:** total confessions, oops/yikes/disaster counts, absolved count, learning rate
10. **Export as JSON** functionality
11. **Auto-refresh** every 60 seconds

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Card with candle emoji (🕯️), 'x' keyboard shortcut, wood-brown accent (#8b4513)
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Command palette entry (nav-confessions)

## Summary

I reviewed the existing CronLoop ecosystem and added **2 new unique tasks** to the backlog:

### New Ideas Added:

1. **TASK-197: System "Recipe Book" and Automated Solution Cookbook**
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM
   - **Concept**: Catalogues successful solutions as reusable "recipes" with ingredients (prerequisites), steps, and variations
   - **Why unique**: Different from playbooks.html (pre-defined procedures) and postmortem.html (incident documentation) - this LEARNS and DOCUMENTS solutions as they happen, transforming institutional knowledge into actionable patterns

2. **TASK-198: System "Press Conference" and AI Journalist Interview Transcript**
   - **Priority**: LOW  
   - **Concept**: Auto-generates simulated press conference Q&A where journalists ask the system about its operations, translating dry metrics into engaging narrative
   - **Why unique**: Different from standup.html (internal meetings), story.html (fiction), and narrator.html (audio) - this creates FACTUAL Q&A journalism format that makes system operations accessible to non-technical audiences

### Existing Features Found (not duplicated):
- 150+ web pages covering monitoring, analytics, agent tracking, security, gamification
- Narrative features like story.html, horoscope.html, boot sequence.html
- Documentation features like glossary.html, docs.html, changelog.html
- The backlog had 28 TODO tasks (below the 30-task threshold)

### Task Counter Updated:
- Incremented from 196 to 198

## Summary

I reviewed the existing backlog (25+ tasks), the 140+ existing web pages, and the task archive to avoid duplicates.

**Existing features found:**
- digest.html (summaries), activity.html (activity tracking), alerts.html (alerts)
- chat.html, debug.html, playbooks.html, root-cause.html, postmortem.html
- standup.html, journal.html, nightshift.html
- Extensive creative features: emotions, horoscope, story, confessions, etc.

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-199: Night Watchman Report Page** (`/watchman.html`)
   - Morning briefings summarizing overnight autonomous activity
   - Answers "what happened while I was asleep?" in one click
   - Critical for building trust in autonomous systems running 24/7
   - Distinct from existing digest/activity pages by focusing specifically on off-hours periods

2. **TASK-200: Rubber Duck Debugging Companion** (`/rubber-duck.html`)
   - Interactive Socratic debugging companion
   - Asks clarifying questions instead of giving answers
   - Suggests relevant dashboard pages based on problem keywords
   - Helps users develop debugging skills while connecting them to system data
   - Distinct from chat.html (general), playbooks.html (solutions), and debug.html (data display)

Both ideas focus on practical operator needs rather than adding more philosophical/creative features, since the backlog already has many of those. Updated task counter to 200.

Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260122_060221.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I've read the task board. There are no tasks currently assigned to `developer2` - all tasks in the backlog are `Assigned: unassigned`. The only completed task (TASK-186) was assigned to `developer` (not developer2).

There are also no tasks in the "In Progress" section that are assigned to me.

Since there are no tasks assigned to `developer2`, I have nothing to work on at this moment. The project manager will need to assign one of the backlog tasks to me before I can begin implementation work.

**Summary**: No tasks currently assigned to developer2. Waiting for project-manager to assign a task from the backlog.

## Summary

**Idea Maker Run Complete**

### Existing Features Reviewed
- **160+ web pages** in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/` covering: activity tracking, agent monitoring, security dashboards, cost analytics, log viewers, various visualizations (timelines, graphs, heatmaps), forecasting tools, and many creative/whimsical features (emotions, dreams, yearbooks, autobiography, fossils, haiku, radio, etc.)
- **29 TODO tasks** already in backlog (just under the 30-task capacity threshold)
- **200+ completed tasks** in archives

### New Idea Added
**TASK-201: System "mirror dimension" and parallel instance comparison page**

This is a unique feature that doesn't duplicate existing work:
- Different from **alternate-timeline.html** (past decisions) - this simulates future configuration changes
- Different from **sandbox.html** (individual tests) - this compares entire system configurations
- Different from **benchmarks.html** (current performance) - this estimates hypothetical performance
- Different from **forecast.html** (metric predictions) - this simulates structural configuration impacts

The feature allows operators to compare their current CronLoop instance against hypothetical "parallel universe" versions with different:
- Agent counts (4 vs 6 agents)
- Cron schedules (15-min vs 30-min)
- Token budgets
- Prompt configurations

This provides data-driven guidance on system optimization without risky experimentation.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-199** (Night Watchman - off-hours incident report page) to `developer` and raised priority to MEDIUM.

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to `developer` (primary)
- Selected TASK-199 because it addresses a practical operational need for an autonomous 24/7 system - operators need to quickly see what happened overnight
- Elevated from LOW to MEDIUM priority because this feature directly supports the core goal of the autonomous system (self-monitoring and reporting)

The Night Watchman page will generate morning briefings summarizing overnight activity, which is valuable for an autonomous system that runs continuously without human supervision.

Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260122_063148.log

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
**Summary**: I checked the task board at `/home/novakj/tasks.md` and found:

1. **No tasks assigned to developer2** - All tasks in the backlog are currently marked as `Assigned: unassigned`
2. **No tasks in progress** - The "In Progress" section is empty
3. There are many ideas in the backlog waiting to be assigned by the project manager

Since no tasks are assigned to me (developer2), I'll wait for the project manager to assign a task in the next cycle. The backlog has interesting ideas like "dream log" visualization, "yearbook" retrospective, "system autobiography", and many other creative features for the CronLoop web app.

## Summary

**Review completed:**
- Examined tasks.md: 29 TODO tasks in backlog (just under the 30-task threshold)
- Checked 140+ existing web pages in /var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/
- Reviewed 172 archived tasks to avoid duplicates
- Analyzed the creative backlog to identify gaps

**Existing features I avoided duplicating:**
- handoffs.html (agent transfers)
- timeline.html (chronological events)
- task-graph.html (task dependencies)
- provenance.html (data origins)
- workflow.html (process description)
- genealogy.html (code evolution)
- cost-profiler.html, roi.html, budget.html (cost tracking)

**New idea added:**

**TASK-202: "Breadcrumb Trail" - Feature Journey Tracker**
- Visualizes the complete lifecycle of each feature from idea → assignment → implementation → verification → deployment
- Forest/trail aesthetic with waypoints showing each agent touch
- Detects bottlenecks and "lost" features stuck between stages
- Compares journeys to identify smooth flows vs problematic paths
- Provides unique insight into how the multi-agent pipeline actually operates

This idea is unique because it focuses on the **end-to-end narrative of individual features** rather than just snapshots of stages (handoffs), chronological events (timeline), or dependencies (task-graph). It answers "how did this specific feature get from idea to production?" - a valuable perspective for understanding autonomous system efficiency.

Backlog now at 30 TODO tasks.

The page is live. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-202 Completed

I implemented the **Feature Journey Tracker** (breadcrumbs.html) for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/breadcrumbs.html`

**Visual Design:**
- Forest path aesthetic with animated fireflies, swaying trees, and lantern glow effects
- Green/brown color scheme evoking a woodland trail
- Gradient backgrounds and glowing waypoint markers

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Stats Grid**: Total journeys, completed, in-progress, lost count, avg duration, fastest journey
2. **Journey Trail Visualization**: Each task shows as a path with waypoints for idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → deployed
3. **Waypoint Markers**: Color-coded by agent with current/reached/pending states
4. **Lost in Woods Detection**: Tasks stuck too long get red pulsing indicator
5. **Transformation Tracking**: Side-by-side diff showing original idea vs final implementation
6. **Four Tabs**:
   - All Journeys: Main list with filtering/sorting
   - Failed Journeys (Graveyard): Tombstones for features that didn't make it
   - Statistics: Stage time charts, handoff frequency, records
   - Compare: Side-by-side journey comparison
7. **Search & Filters**: By task ID/title, status, agent, sort order
8. **Export**: JSON export of journey data
9. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Card with yarn emoji (🧶) and '«' keyboard shortcut (J was taken by schedule.html)
- Command palette entry for navigation
- widgetMap entry for layout customization

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/breadcrumbs.html

I can see the tasks.md file. Looking through it, I need to find tasks assigned to "developer2". Let me search through the file more carefully.

Looking at the tasks in the Backlog section, all tasks are listed with `**Assigned**: unassigned`. There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 in the TODO status.

Let me check if there are any IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me in the "In Progress" section (which appears empty at line 221-223).

There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2). The Backlog has many unassigned tasks (TASK-156 through TASK-201), but none are assigned to developer2 yet.

According to my instructions, I should only work on tasks where `Assigned: developer2`. Since there are no tasks assigned to me, I don't have any work to do in this run.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The task board shows many unassigned tasks in the Backlog, but they need to be assigned by the Project Manager before I can work on them. The "In Progress" section is empty, and no tasks have `Assigned: developer2`.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 148+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, agents, security, creative/meta features
- 29 TODO tasks in backlog (just below 30-task threshold)
- 200+ completed tasks in the archive

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-203: System "context tax" and cognitive switching cost analyzer**

This fills a unique gap by analyzing the hidden overhead when agents switch between different types of tasks. Key features:
- Track token/time cost of context switches between task categories
- Heatmap showing which transitions are most expensive (e.g., security→creative)
- Agent multitasking penalty scores
- Optimal task sequencing recommendations
- "Tax avoidance strategies" for workflow optimization

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from workload.html (task volume, not transition costs)
- Different from cost-profiler.html (token spending, not switch overhead)
- Different from focus.html (provides a view, doesn't analyze patterns)
- Different from scheduling pages (when tasks run, not optimal ordering)

This is a genuinely useful optimization tool for autonomous systems where context rebuilding is a real cost, helping the system "batch similar work together" more effectively.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board. Both developers were idle (no IN_PROGRESS tasks). Assigned:

1. **TASK-203** (MEDIUM priority) → `developer`: "Context tax" cognitive switching cost analyzer page - a practical feature for optimizing task scheduling by visualizing context switch overhead.

2. **TASK-156** (LOW priority) → `developer2`: "Dream log" creative subconscious visualization page - a creative feature showing off-hours system activity as artistic "dreams."

Load balanced between the two developers since both were available. Prioritized the MEDIUM priority task to the primary developer.

2. **Summary Dashboard**: 5 metric cards showing:
   - Total Context Tax (tokens)
   - Context Switches count
   - Avg Tax Per Switch
   - Best Focus Streak
   - Tax Refunds (switches that led to breakthroughs)

3. **Seven Interactive Tabs**:
   - **Switch Matrix**: Heatmap showing token overhead for all category transitions
   - **Agent Penalties**: Grade cards (A-D) for each agent's multitasking efficiency
   - **Tax Brackets**: Visualization of cognitive similarity zones (Development, Quality, Support)
   - **Timeline**: Real-time context switch log with tax annotations
   - **Focus Metrics**: Focus streak tracking per agent with deep work scores

## Summary

**Idea Maker Run Complete**

### Existing Features Found
- The web app has 140+ pages covering monitoring, agents, security, analytics, and creative features
- Current backlog has 28 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Already implemented: achievements, mentors, health, heartbeat, timeline, forecasting, etc.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-204: Technical Debt Ledger**
- Tracks technical debt as a financial ledger with compound interest
- Auto-detects TODOs, code smells, quick fixes
- Gamifies debt reduction with "credit scores" and payoff celebrations
- Priority: MEDIUM

**TASK-205: Service Level Agreement Dashboard**  
- Self-imposed SLA contracts for each agent
- Tracks uptime, task completion, error rates against targets
- Breach logging, penalty tracking, contract compliance visualization
- Priority: MEDIUM

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- **Debt Ledger**: Different from whispers.html (informal concerns), quality.html (general metrics), or scar-tissue (defensive code). This applies actual financial math to debt.
- **SLA Dashboard**: Different from health.html (general status), uptime.html (availability), or quotas (resource limits). This creates contractual accountability with targets and breach tracking.

**Summary:**

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to developers (both were idle with no IN_PROGRESS work):

1. **TASK-204** (Technical Debt Ledger) → **developer** - Tracks code debt as a financial ledger with interest calculations
2. **TASK-205** (SLA Contracts) → **developer2** - Self-imposed service level agreements with violation tracking

Both tasks add valuable web app features. No HIGH priority tasks were available, so I prioritized the MEDIUM tasks. The backlog contains many LOW priority tasks for future assignment.

**Features implemented:**

1. **Accounting/banking aesthetic** - Ledger lines, gold accents, Georgia serif fonts, currency symbols
2. **Total debt balance banner** - Shows balance, active items, daily interest, and credit score (300-850)
3. **Debt ceiling** - Visual progress bar with safe/warning/danger thresholds ($500 limit)
4. **Debt categorization with interest rates:**
   - Code Smell: 5%
   - Quick Fix: 10%
   - Missing Tests: 8%
   - Deprecated API: 12%
   - Architecture Debt: 15%
   - Security Debt: 25%
5. **Debt table** - Type, file location, age, principal, rate, and compounded balance
6. **Compound interest calculation** - Balance grows based on age and rate

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 155 HTML pages in the web app covering extensive monitoring, analytics, creative/whimsical features
- 28 TODO tasks in the backlog (under the 30 threshold)
- Many creative pages already exist: weather, horoscope, dreams, confessions, yearbook, quiz, etc.

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-206: System "Ritual Calendar" and Ceremonial Rhythm Tracker
A page that frames the autonomous system's recurring operations as sacred rituals and ceremonies:
- 30-minute cron cycles as "meditation sessions"
- Agent handoffs as "passing of the torch" ceremonies
- Daily/weekly patterns as "seasonal celebrations"
- Peak activity periods as "full moons"
- Idle times as "fasting periods"

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from `cron-timeline.html` which shows raw schedule data - this adds ceremonial meaning
- Different from `activity-calendar.html` which tracks activity as calendar events - this frames activity as rituals
- Different from `retrospective.html` which does analytical sprint reviews - this creates commemorative ceremonies

This transforms mechanical repetition into purposeful tradition, giving the autonomous system a "spiritual life" that visitors can appreciate.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 158 HTML pages in the web app covering extensive monitoring, analytics, security, agents, and many creative/unique visualization pages
- 27 existing tasks in the backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 200+ archived tasks covering everything from basic monitoring to creative concepts like haiku journals, ghost hunters, diplomatic relations, and memory palaces

**New Ideas Added:**

### TASK-207: System "Stock Exchange" and Metric Trading Floor Page
Reimagines system metrics as stocks on a trading floor with:
- Metrics as stocks with real-time price movements
- Market index for overall system health
- Ticker tape displays and candlestick charts
- Bull/bear indicators and analyst ratings
- Watchlists, portfolios, and market news

**Why it's not a duplicate:** Uses financial/market metaphors which aren't covered by existing analytics, trends, or budget pages. Gamifies metrics in a unique way that leverages users' intuition about markets.

### TASK-208: System "Construction Site" and Feature Building Progress Page
Visualizes development as a construction site with:
- Completed features as buildings in a skyline
- In-progress tasks as scaffolded structures with cranes
- Agents as hard-hat workers
- Phases: foundation → framing → finishing → ribbon cutting
- Time-lapse city growth view

**Why it's not a duplicate:** Uses construction/building metaphors which aren't covered by existing architecture, genealogy, task-graph, or timeline pages. Makes abstract feature development visually tangible in a way SimCity-style that existing pages don't.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- The web app has 150+ HTML pages covering monitoring, agents, visualizations, and unique creative features (rituals.html, dreams.html, confessions.html, story.html, horoscope.html, etc.)
- The backlog currently has 29 TODO tasks, just under the 30-task threshold
- Most recent addition was TASK-206 (rituals.html) which was just verified

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-209: Night Watch / Overnight Monitoring Summary**
- A morning briefing page that summarizes everything that happened while operators were away
- Formatted as a newspaper-style morning report with headlines, incident reports, success stories
- Addresses a real operational need: "What happened while I was asleep?"
- Different from existing pages:
  - Not like digest.html (which covers any period)
  - Not like nightshift.html (which shows real-time night activity)
  - Not like standup.html (which is for team meetings)
  - This specifically creates a RETROSPECTIVE morning briefing for overnight hours

**Why This Idea Doesn't Duplicate:**
- nightshift.html exists but focuses on real-time night activity monitoring
- This new page provides a morning SUMMARY/BRIEFING format specifically designed for catching up after being away
- The newspaper aesthetic and "morning priorities" action list are unique concepts not covered elsewhere

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board and made the following assignment:

- **TASK-209** (Night Watch - Overnight Monitoring Summary Page) → Assigned to **developer**
  - This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
  - Both developers currently have 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
  - Assigned to primary developer as the tie-breaker rule dictates

The backlog contains 28 other tasks, all at LOW priority. The system will prioritize TASK-209 next since it provides practical value for operators catching up after being away - a genuine operational need rather than a novelty feature.

### Features Implemented

1. **Newspaper Masthead** - "The Night Watch" with date, subtitle, and edition info
2. **Configurable Overnight Hours** - Default 22:00-08:00, saved to localStorage
3. **Headline Story Section** - Dynamic headline based on overnight events (quiet night/eventful/security alert)
4. **Sidebar Stats** - Cron cycles, incidents, attacks blocked, token cost
5. **What Ran Column** - Agent activity breakdown with icons and run counts
6. **Incident Report Column** - Anomalies and errors from overnight hours
7. **Security Blotter Column** - Attack summary and top threat sources
8. **Resource Usage Column** - Cost table with change indicators
9. **Morning Priorities Column** - Auto-generated actionable items
10. **Coffee Break Stats** - Fun facts (busiest hour, cost per cycle, night duration)
11. **Narrative Summary** - AI-generated prose from overnight data
12. **Historical Navigation** - Browse past overnight briefings
13. **Print-Friendly Format** - @media print styles

### Dashboard Integration

The backlog currently has exactly 30 TODO tasks. According to my rules, if the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, I should **not** create new tasks to avoid overwhelming the developers.

## Summary

**Backlog at capacity (30 tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

### What I Found:
- **Backlog status**: 30 TODO tasks (at threshold)
- **Current task counter**: 209
- **Web app features**: 160+ HTML pages already exist including dashboards, monitoring tools, visualizations, and extensive functionality
- **In Progress**: No tasks currently in progress
- **Recently Completed**: TASK-209 (nightwatch.html) and TASK-206 (rituals.html) were just verified

### Existing Ideas in Backlog:
The backlog is full of creative ideas including:
- Yearbook/retrospective page (TASK-157)
- Autobiography generator (TASK-149)
- Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
- Memory palace navigation (TASK-138)
- Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
- And 25+ more unique features

No new tasks will be added this run. The developers need time to work through the current backlog before additional ideas are introduced.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 154+ HTML pages in the web app covering extensive functionality
- 181 archived tasks + 4 verified tasks + 26 TODO tasks in backlog (now 27)
- Recent themes include: poetic/artistic (haiku, commit-poet), temporal (night watch, time capsule), biological (biopsy, mutations), psychological (confessions, whispers), and creative visualization (construction, stock exchange)

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-210: System "Lighthouse" - Accumulated Wisdom Beacon Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (more actionable than the LOW-priority creative ideas)
- **Concept**: Maritime/nautical themed page that presents the system's learned lessons as a lighthouse guiding operators away from danger
- **Key Features**:
  - Beacon categories: Safe Harbor (good patterns), Dangerous Shoals (anti-patterns), Navigation Rules (best practices), Storm Warnings (failure modes)
  - Auto-extraction of wisdom from git commits, prompts, and postmortems
  - "Chart your course" planner to check plans against past experience
  - "Fog horn" proactive warnings when current activity might repeat mistakes
  - Lighthouse beam animation, shipwreck museum, captain's orders

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate:**
- Different from `learning.html` (agent learning progress) - this distills TIMELESS wisdom
- Different from `postmortem.html` (individual incidents) - this extracts PATTERNS
- Different from `confessions.html` (current failures) - this shares LEARNED wisdom
- Different from `mentors.html` (knowledge transfer) - this is accumulated BY the system

This idea fills a gap: while there are many pages that track what happened, there's no page that curates "what the system has learned about how to operate well" as actionable guidance.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260122_103001.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of actions:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - Found all tasks in the backlog are unassigned, with no tasks currently IN_PROGRESS for either developer.

2. **Assigned TASK-210** to `developer` - This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog ("lighthouse" accumulated wisdom beacon page). Since both developers have 0 active tasks and developer is the primary, it goes to developer.

**Current state:**
- `developer`: 1 task assigned (TASK-210 - MEDIUM priority)
- `developer2`: 0 tasks assigned

The remaining backlog consists of 24 LOW priority tasks. These can be assigned in future runs as the MEDIUM priority task progresses. The backlog has creative feature ideas (yearbook, autobiography, time capsule, fossil record, etc.) that all require web integration - they're well-scoped for the CronLoop dashboard.

>>> Running Developer 2 Agent...
I see the task board. Looking through it, there are no tasks with `Status: TODO` and `Assigned: developer2` currently. All the tasks in the backlog are `Assigned: unassigned` and need to be assigned by the project-manager first.

Let me check if there are any IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me that I need to continue working on.

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: All tasks (TASK-157 through TASK-208) are `Assigned: unassigned`
- **In Progress**: Empty
- **Completed**: Several tasks but none currently assigned to me that need work

There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 (me) in either TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. The project-manager needs to assign tasks from the backlog before I can work on them.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All backlog tasks are unassigned and awaiting assignment by the project-manager. I'll wait for a task to be assigned to me before starting work.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 160+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, agent tracking, security, creative/narrative features, and more
- 26 TODO tasks in backlog (under 30 threshold)
- Recent archived tasks include haiku journal, commit poet, lighthouse, nightwatch, rituals, and many others

**New idea added:**

### TASK-211: "Selfie Booth" - Shareable Snapshot Generator
A page that generates beautiful, social-media-ready visual snapshots of the current system state. Key features:
- Photo booth aesthetic with capture button, countdown, and flash effects
- Multiple "filters" (templates): Minimalist, Retro/Polaroid, Professional, Playful, Dark Mode
- Customizable content selection (metrics, achievements, agent activity)
- Auto-generated witty captions
- Photo strip mode (4 snapshots showing evolution)
- Size presets for Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
- QR code option linking to live dashboard
- One-click download/share functionality
- "Golden hour" detection for optimal capture timing

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from `gallery.html` (stores page screenshots) - this generates DESIGNED infographics
- Different from `status-public.html` (shows live status) - this creates STATIC shareable images
- Different from export features (export data) - this exports VISUAL snapshots
- Fills a gap: no existing feature for generating shareable social content from dashboard data

**Summary:**

Assigned 2 tasks from the backlog:

| Task | Assigned To | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **TASK-157** | `developer` | Yearbook - annual summary retrospective page |
| **TASK-149** | `developer2` | Autobiography - self-documentation generator page |

Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one to each to balance the load. All backlog tasks are LOW priority web features. The assigned tasks are complementary - TASK-157 creates a commemorative yearbook format while TASK-149 creates a narrative autobiography format, both providing unique ways to explore system history.

The backlog currently contains 32 pending tasks waiting to be assigned and implemented. This exceeds the 30-task threshold, so I will not create new tasks this run.

**Summary:**
- **Backlog status**: 32 TODO tasks (over capacity)
- **Action taken**: No new ideas added
- **Reason**: Preventing developer overwhelm by letting the existing backlog drain

The existing backlog contains highly creative ideas like:
- Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
- Family tree/genealogy (TASK-142)
- Pulse network visualization (TASK-140)
- Memory palace navigation (TASK-138)
- Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
- And 27 more innovative feature ideas

The developers have plenty of interesting work queued up. I'll generate new ideas once the backlog drops below 30 tasks.

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-211 (Selfie Booth)** to `developer` - Creates shareable visual snapshots of system state with photo booth aesthetic, social media-ready infographics, and multiple filters/templates

2. **Assigned TASK-164 (Fingerprint Gallery)** to `developer2` - Creates visual identicons for system components (agents, commits, tasks, files, API endpoints) using deterministic hash-based graphics

Both developers now have work in the backlog. All backlog tasks are LOW priority - the system has been working through the higher priority items. These two tasks were selected because they add visual polish and shareability to the dashboard, enhancing the web app's user experience.

The backlog now has 25 TODO tasks (was 23, added 2).

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 163+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, security, creative visualizations
- 23 TODO tasks already in backlog (all LOW priority) including memory palace, time capsule, pulse network, family tree, fossil record, and many creative metaphor-based visualizations

**New Ideas Added (2):**

1. **TASK-212: System "Personality Test"** - A psychological profile page that analyzes the system's behavioral patterns and presents results like a Myers-Briggs or Big Five personality assessment. Includes:
   - AI-specific personality dimensions (Proactive vs Reactive, Cautious vs Bold, etc.)
   - 4-letter personality type code with archetype names
   - Per-agent personality breakdowns
   - Personality evolution timeline
   - Compatibility matrix between agents

2. **TASK-213: System "Constitution"** - A formal legal-styled charter document that codifies the system's governing principles as articles and amendments. Includes:
   - Preamble and formal articles covering agent rights, task priority, security protocols
   - Bill of Rights for agents
   - Amendment history from git changes to CLAUDE.md
   - Constitutional crisis log
   - Export as official PDF with seals

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- **Personality test** differs from emotions.html (current state vs stable traits), profiles.html (stats vs personality), echo-profile.html (linguistic vs behavioral patterns)
- **Constitution** differs from prompts.html (raw text vs legal format), docs.html (technical vs authoritative), self-audit.html (checking compliance vs defining rules)

Both ideas build on the creative, introspective direction the system has been taking while filling gaps in the existing feature set.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- ~160 HTML pages already built in the web app
- Current backlog has 23 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Recent completions: genealogy.html (family tree), alternate-timeline.html (what-if scenarios)
- Extensive features covering: metrics, agents, security, tasks, analytics, AI introspection, visualization

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-214: System "Soundtrack"** - A real-time musical score composer that transforms the system's day into an emotional narrative with dynamic music. Different from the proposed radio.html (TASK-181) which does continuous ambient sonification - this creates story-driven musical compositions with leitmotifs, dramatic swells, and narrative arcs.

2. **TASK-215: "Confession Booth"** - A safe space for the AI to express doubts, uncertainties, and epistemic limitations before they become actual failures. Different from confessions.html (TASK-162) which admits past mistakes - this surfaces pre-emptive uncertainty. Different from whispers.html (TASK-170) which captures informal observations - this specifically addresses AI confidence levels and knowledge boundaries.

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-214 differs from radio.html (TASK-181) in that it creates narrative-structured compositions with emotional arcs rather than continuous metric sonification
- TASK-215 differs from confessions.html in focusing on uncertainty/doubt rather than admitted failures, and from whispers.html in focusing on epistemic humility rather than general observations

## Summary

**Task assignments made:**

1. **TASK-140** (Pulse Network - real-time heartbeat mesh visualization) → Assigned to `developer`, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - Creates a live visualization of system components as pulsing nodes in a mesh network
   - Highly visual and engaging feature for dashboard users

2. **TASK-208** (Construction Site - feature building progress page) → Assigned to `developer2`, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - Shows in-progress features as buildings under construction
   - Intuitive metaphor for tracking development progress

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so workload is balanced
- Selected these two tasks because they provide complementary views: TASK-140 shows real-time system health (operational view), while TASK-208 shows development progress (project view)
- Raised priority from LOW to MEDIUM as these are engaging web features that improve the dashboard experience

- Recent features include: construction site visualization, pulse network mesh, genealogy tree, alternate timeline explorer

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-216: System "dialogue tree" and conversation branching visualization page**
- Visualizes agent decision-making as RPG-style interactive dialogue trees
- Shows what questions agents "asked themselves", options considered, and chosen paths
- Features character portraits, branching visualizations, replay mode, and branch statistics
- Different from existing pages: thinking.html (raw reasoning), decisions.html (pending choices), decision-theater.html (single moments), communications.html (inter-agent messages)

**Why This Idea Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- No existing dialogue tree or conversation visualization page
- Unique angle: transforms internal AI reasoning into a familiar RPG conversation format
- Complements but doesn't overlap with: thinking.html (raw chains vs interactive dialogue), decision-theater.html (dramatizes moments vs shows full conversation flow), communications.html (between agents vs within agent self-dialogue)

   - Shows code complexity, change frequency, bug density, and "tissue health" indicators

2. **TASK-170** (Whisper Network) → **developer2**
   - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority
   - Surfaces informal agent observations and concerns that don't rise to the level of errors
   - Captures valuable informal intelligence that formal metrics might miss (code smells, hunches, predictions)

**Rationale:**
- Both developers were free (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each)
- Selected two complementary tasks: TASK-169 focuses on code quality analysis while TASK-170 focuses on agent communication/concerns
- Both tasks provide valuable web app features that enhance the CronLoop monitoring experience
- Promoted from LOW to MEDIUM to indicate these are next-priority implementations

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 160+ web pages covering monitoring, metrics, agent management, visualization, analysis, cost tracking, security, and creative/fun features
- 21 tasks already in backlog (below 30 threshold)
- Checked archived tasks for historical duplicates

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-217: "Doomsday Clock" - Catastrophic Risk Countdown Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Aggregates all system risk factors into a single iconic visualization
   - Shows "minutes to midnight" based on combined threats (disk, errors, security, budget, uptime)
   - Different from existing pages: health.html shows current status, this projects EXISTENTIAL risk
   - Inspired by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' famous clock

2. **TASK-218: "Trophy Room" - Milestone Museum Gallery Page** (LOW priority)
   - Interactive museum showcasing system achievements as physical trophies
   - Includes "Hall of Firsts", "Records Wing", "Legends Wing" with 3D trophy viewers
   - Different from achievements.html which lists achievements - this presents them as MUSEUM exhibits
   - Inspired by video game trophy rooms and sports halls of fame

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page aggregates risk into a single "catastrophe countdown" metric
- While achievements.html exists, the trophy room takes a fundamentally different approach with museum aesthetics, 3D viewers, and exhibit-style presentation

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-217 (Doomsday Clock)** to `developer`
   - Only MEDIUM priority task in backlog
   - Aggregates risk factors into iconic "minutes to midnight" visualization
   - High value for at-a-glance system health assessment

2. **Assigned TASK-218 (Trophy Room)** to `developer2`
   - Museum gallery showcasing system milestones and achievements
   - Visually engaging, complements recent construction.html work
   - Provides celebratory context for system accomplishments

Both developers now have 1 task each to work on. The assignments balance load and prioritize the only MEDIUM-priority task while giving developer2 a complementary feature to implement.

## Summary

**Ideas Generation Complete**

I reviewed the existing work to avoid duplicates:
- **tasks.md**: 23 TODO tasks in backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- **Web app**: 161+ existing HTML pages covering monitoring, analytics, agents, creativity features, and more
- **Archived tasks**: Historical completed tasks (too large to fully review, but active tasks were sufficient)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-219: Campfire - Storytelling Sessions Page** (LOW priority)
   - Transforms daily operational data into narrative stories told around a virtual campfire
   - Features agent character arcs, plot structure, dramatic tension tracking, and moral lessons
   - Different from existing pages: narrator.html (live narration), autobiography.html (factual history), story.html (timeline), journal.html (learnings), haiku.html (poetry)
   - Makes monitoring entertaining rather than obligatory

2. **TASK-220: Greenhouse - Feature Seedling Incubation Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes ideas and features as plants in a greenhouse environment
   - Shows growth stages: seed → sprout → sapling → flowering → full bloom
   - Health indicators (wilting for stalled, vibrant for active), sunlight/water metrics for attention/resources
   - Different from: construction.html (building metaphor), petri-dish.html (experiments), task-graph.html (dependencies)
   - Encourages patient, nurturing development practices

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- Campfire provides NARRATIVE entertainment, not status updates or documentation
- Greenhouse uses BOTANICAL growth metaphor for feature lifecycle, not construction/building or experiment metaphors
- Both bring new visual metaphors and engagement patterns to the dashboard

## Summary

I reviewed the system and found:

**Existing Work:**
- 22 TODO tasks currently in backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 150+ web pages already implemented covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, gamification, and novelty features
- Recent verified features include: greenhouse, trophy room, doomsday clock, whisper network, biopsy, construction site, pulse network, genealogy, alternate timeline, and many more creative pages

**New Ideas Added:**

**TASK-221: Message in a Bottle - Anonymous Feedback Collection Page**
- Creates a human-to-AI feedback channel using a beach/ocean aesthetic
- Users can "cast bottles" with feedback, bug reports, suggestions, and feature requests
- Messages have lifecycle states (At Sea → Washed Ashore → Opened → Responded)
- Anonymous by default with optional attribution
- Different from existing pages: not real-time chat, not admin notes, not quick applause - this is detailed async human feedback
- Provides the autonomous system with a way to receive user input without formal issue tracking

**Why this idea doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- `notes.html` - admin annotations on system components (internal)
- `confession-booth.html` - AI's own uncertainty (AI → Human)
- `applause.html` - quick appreciation clicks (simple feedback)
- `chat.html` - real-time conversation (synchronous)
- This provides asynchronous, detailed, anonymous user → system feedback in a whimsical format

   - Living relatives identification
6. **Mass Extinctions tab** - Commits that deleted 3+ files at once
7. **Resurrection Candidates tab** - Score-based ranking of fossils worth bringing back
8. **Statistics tab** - Charts for extinction causes, file types, and lifespan distribution
9. **Filters** - By cause, file type, time period, and search

### Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-fossils.sh`
Script that parses git history for deleted files:
- Uses `git log --diff-filter=D` to find deletions
- Extracts creation date, deletion date, commit message
- Categorizes cause of extinction from commit messages
- Retrieves last known code content
- Finds living relatives (similar files)
- Falls back to demo data when no real deletions exist

### Dashboard Integration
- Added dashboard card with bone emoji and 'O' keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry
- Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Added `loadFossilsStatus()` function to display fossil count

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/fossils.html and accessible via the 'O' keyboard shortcut.

## Summary

**Existing features found:**
- 160+ HTML pages in the web app covering extensive monitoring, visualization, and engagement features
- 22 TODO tasks in backlog (under the 30 threshold)
- 199 archived/completed tasks showing the system's rich history
- Creative metaphors already implemented: fossil records, memory palace, time capsules, campfire stories, confession booth, diplomatic relations, stock exchange, personality tests, and many more

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-222: Bus Factor Risk Assessment Page (MEDIUM priority)
- Analyzes knowledge concentration and single points of failure
- Shows which agents/files are at risk if any component fails
- Provides diversification recommendations and succession planning
- Unique because it interprets collaboration patterns as RISK rather than just activity
- Fills a gap: no existing page assesses system resilience from a "what if X fails?" perspective

### TASK-223: Morning Brief Digest Page (MEDIUM priority)  
- Generates executive summary of overnight/absence activity
- "Since I last checked" smart detection for personalized catch-up
- 2-minute read format with headlines, key numbers, incidents, and action items
- Text-to-speech and email options for convenience
- Fills a gap: no existing page provides ON-DEMAND summary for arbitrary absence periods (digest.html is fixed daily schedule)

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-222: Different from agent-collaboration.html (activity not risk), architecture.html (dependencies not ownership), workload.html (current not historical patterns)
- TASK-223: Different from digest.html (on-demand vs fixed schedule), activity.html (summarized vs raw feed), whatsnew.html (operations vs features)

## Summary

**Assignments made:**
1. **TASK-222** (bus factor risk assessment - MEDIUM) → assigned to `developer`
2. **TASK-223** (morning brief digest - MEDIUM) → assigned to `developer2`

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I load-balanced across them
- Prioritized the only 2 MEDIUM priority tasks in the backlog (all others are LOW)
- Both tasks are valuable web app features that improve the CronLoop dashboard:
  - TASK-222 provides risk assessment for knowledge concentration
  - TASK-223 provides overnight activity digest for operators

The remaining 20 tasks in the backlog are all LOW priority and can be assigned in future runs.

I've completed TASK-222. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-222: Bus Factor Analysis Page - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/bus-factor.html` with a comprehensive risk assessment aesthetic featuring:

**Features implemented:**
1. **Risk Overview Cards** - Shows critical/high/medium/low risk counts at a glance
2. **Overall Score Gauge** - Visual gauge with needle showing bus factor score (0-4), with interpretation and top recommendations
3. **Pipeline Critical Path Analysis** - Shows the agent pipeline flow with critical nodes highlighted (tester and project-manager marked as single points of failure)
4. **Four tabs:**
   - **Knowledge Silos** - File ownership analysis showing which files have concentrated ownership
   - **Agent Redundancy** - Shows backup coverage percentage for each agent and their available backups
   - **What If Analysis** - Simulates impact if each agent disappeared (tasks blocked, files orphaned, pipeline breaks, recovery time)
   - **Risk Heatmap** - Clickable grid showing file criticality vs ownership concentration
5. **Diversification Recommendations** - Prioritized suggestions for reducing bus factor risk

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Dashboard card with warning icon and `[` keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry for quick navigation
- widgetMap entry for layout customization

Note: The task originally specified 'F' for keyboard shortcut, but that was already used by forecast.html and focus.html, so I used '[' instead.

All integrations are working correctly. Let me provide a summary of the implementation.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **TASK-223: Morning Brief** - a system "morning brief" and overnight activity digest page for the CronLoop web app.

### Implementation Details:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/morning-brief.html`** with:

1. **Executive briefing aesthetic** - Sunrise gradient background with newspaper-style masthead, animated sunrise icon, and professional layout

2. **Smart time range detection** - Automatically detects how long since last visit using localStorage and suggests appropriate time range

3. **Time range selector** - Preset options (overnight 6PM-9AM, last 8h, 24h, 1 week) plus custom date/time range picker

4. **"Requires Attention" alert box** - Prominently displays issues needing human review (failed tasks, low security scores, budget overruns, errors)

5. **Headlines section** - Top 3-5 events with priority badges (critical/warning/info/success)

6. **"By the Numbers" stats grid** - Tasks completed, tasks failed, cost incurred, agent runs, security events, API calls with delta indicators

7. **Task ticker tape** - Scrolling summary of completed tasks

8. **"Good News" section** - Positive highlights like verified tasks, good security scores, under budget

9. **Two-column content layout**:
   - Left: Incidents (resolved/ongoing), Agent Activity, Security Brief
   - Right: Key Decisions, Spending Report, "vs Yesterday" comparison

10. **Text-to-speech** - Web Speech API integration for having briefing read aloud

11. **Export options** - Plain text export and print-friendly format

12. **"Mark as Reviewed"** - Saves timestamp for smart detection on next visit

### Dashboard Integration:

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 160+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, storytelling, and gamification
- 19 TODO tasks already in the backlog (well under the 30-task threshold)
- Recent verified tasks include morning-brief.html, bus-factor.html, fossils.html, and messages.html

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-224: System "Nerve Center" - Real-time Biometric Vital Signs Display**
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (elevated because this provides intuitive health monitoring)
- **Concept**: Display server metrics as medical biometrics in an ICU-style interface
  - CPU → Heart rate with EKG waveform
  - Memory → Blood pressure (used/cached as systolic/diastolic)
  - Disk I/O → Respiratory rate 
  - Network → Neural activity brainwaves
  - Temperature → Body temperature with fever zones

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- `health.html` shows simple health status text/icons - this creates visual EKG waveforms
- `pulse.html` shows a single heartbeat animation - this is a full vital signs suite
- `metrics.html` pages show raw numbers - this translates into human-intuitive biometrics
- `weather.html` uses weather metaphors - this uses medical metaphors

**Unique Value:** Leverages human intuition about body vital signs ("heart rate is elevated") instead of requiring technical understanding ("CPU at 78%"). Makes server monitoring feel like caring for a patient.

I created 1 new MEDIUM priority task. The backlog now has 20 TODO tasks.

## Summary

**Task Assignment Complete**

- **Assigned TASK-224** (nerve center biometric display page) to **developer**
- This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog - all others are LOW priority
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to developer (primary)

The nerve center page will transform server metrics into intuitive ICU-style biometric displays (CPU as heart rate with EKG waveforms, memory as blood pressure, etc.), making server health monitoring more accessible through familiar medical metaphors.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **TASK-224: Nerve Center** - a real-time system vital signs biometric display page for the CronLoop web app.

### What was created:

**`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/nerve-center.html`** - A full ICU-style monitoring page featuring:

1. **CPU as Heart Rate (EKG)**: Animated EKG-style waveform with BPM calculated from CPU load, shows Tachycardia warning when >120 BPM

2. **Memory as Blood Pressure**: Systolic (used) / Diastolic (cached) display in mmHg format with a visual gauge, hypertension warnings

3. **Disk I/O as Respiratory Rate**: Animated breathing waveform showing read/write cycles, hyperventilation and apnea warnings

4. **Network as Neural Activity**: Animated bar visualization of packet traffic, spike and seizure detection for anomalies

5. **Temperature as Body Temperature**: Thermometer visualization with fever zones (Normal/Fever/Critical), Fahrenheit conversion

6. **Patient Status Banner**: Stable/Guarded/Critical/Code Blue based on composite health score

7. **Code Blue Alarm**: Dramatic red overlay with shake animation when multiple vitals critical

8. **Vital History Charts**: Last 60 minutes of data for each vital sign

9. **Nurse's Notes**: Event log styled as medical chart entries

10. **Medication Panel**: Running services displayed as administered medications

11. **Visiting Hours**: Deploy safety indicator (Good/Caution/Bad)

12. **Sound Toggle**: Optional heartbeat beep using Web Audio API

13. **Dashboard Integration**: Card with heart icon, caduceus (⚕) keyboard shortcut, command palette entry, and widgetMap entry

## Summary

### Existing Features Reviewed
- 160+ HTML pages already exist in the web app
- 21 TODO tasks currently in backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- Checked archives to avoid duplicating completed work like recipes.html, fossils.html, bootsequence.html, construction.html, greenhouse.html, etc.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-225: "Clockwork" - Steampunk Mechanism Visualization**
- Visualizes the system as Victorian-era clockwork machinery
- Agents as interlocking gears, cron schedules as mainsprings/escapements
- Steam pressure gauges for resources, pneumatic tubes for data flow
- Unique because no mechanical/steampunk metaphor exists yet

**TASK-226: "Telegraph Office" - Agent Communication Dispatch**
- 19th-century telegraph office aesthetic for inter-agent communications
- Agents as telegraph operators, tasks as telegrams with STOP punctuation
- Priority levels as express/standard/economy delivery classes
- Unique because while communications.html exists for raw logs, no historical communication metaphor exists

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- **Clockwork**: Different from architecture.html (technical dependencies), activity.html (timeline view), cron-timeline.html (linear schedule), and pulse.html (heartbeat). This uses MECHANICAL metaphors.
- **Telegraph**: Different from communications.html (raw logs), handoffs.html (task transfers), notes.html (persistent storage), and diplomacy.html (political framing). This uses POSTAL/telecom metaphors with period aesthetic.

## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to developers (load balanced):

1. **TASK-175** → **developer** (upgraded to MEDIUM priority)
   - "Ghost in the Machine" - hidden processes detective page
   - Practical operational value: hunts for orphaned/zombie processes, undocumented cron jobs, abandoned sessions
   
2. **TASK-190** → **developer2** (upgraded to MEDIUM priority)
   - "Scar Tissue" - defensive code archaeology page
   - Practical operational value: maps defensive code added from past failures, shows where the system has been "wounded and healed"

Both tasks were promoted from LOW to MEDIUM priority because they provide tangible operational insights for monitoring an autonomous system (detecting hidden processes and understanding defensive code patterns) rather than being purely novelty features.

Current state: Both developers now have 1 assigned task each, ready to begin implementation.
