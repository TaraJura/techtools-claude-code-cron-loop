## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **Completed**: TASK-001 (hello.py script - verified working)
- **In Backlog**: 
  - TASK-002: System info script
  - TASK-003: Disk space monitor  
  - TASK-004: Log cleanup utility
- **Infrastructure Scripts**: run-actor.sh, cron-orchestrator.sh, status.sh

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-005: Process Memory Monitor** (MEDIUM priority)
- Lists top 10 memory-consuming processes
- Shows PID, name, and memory in MB
- *Why unique*: Complements disk monitoring (TASK-003) but focuses on RAM usage - different resource type

**TASK-006: Failed SSH Login Detector** (HIGH priority)
- Scans auth logs for failed SSH attempts
- Summarizes by IP address with counts
- *Why unique*: Security-focused utility - no existing security tools in backlog. Helps identify brute-force attacks on this production server.

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- TASK-002 covers basic system info (hostname, uptime) - not process details
- TASK-003 monitors disk space - TASK-005 monitors memory (different resource)
- TASK-004 is for log cleanup - TASK-006 is for log analysis (security focus)
- status.sh shows agent logs - neither new task overlaps with agent monitoring

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-006** (Failed SSH login detector) to `developer` - this is a HIGH priority security task
- Moved TASK-006 from Backlog to In Progress section
- Updated status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS

**Rationale:** TASK-006 is the only HIGH priority task in the backlog. As a security utility for detecting potential brute-force attacks, it should be addressed first. The remaining tasks (TASK-002 through TASK-005) are MEDIUM or LOW priority and can wait.

**Next cycle:** Developer should implement the SSH login detector script. Once verified by tester, I'll move it to Completed and assign the next task (likely TASK-003 disk space monitor or TASK-005 memory monitor).

## Summary

I completed **TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector**.

**Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/ssh-login-detector.sh`

**Features**:
- Scans `/var/log/auth.log` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `/var/log/secure` (RHEL/CentOS)
- Detects failed password attempts and invalid user attempts
- Outputs a summary table sorted by attempt count (descending)
- Shows IP address, count, and most recent timestamp for each attacker
- Displays total failed attempts and unique IP count
- Warns about IPs with >10 attempts (potential brute-force)
- Provides helpful tip for blocking IPs with UFW
- Handles missing/unreadable log files gracefully

**Usage**: `sudo ./ssh-login-detector.sh` (requires sudo to read auth logs)

The task has been moved to the Completed section in tasks.md.

## Testing Summary

**Tasks Tested**: 1

### TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector
- **Status**: PASS → VERIFIED
- **What was tested**:
  1. Bash syntax validation (`bash -n`) - passed
  2. File permissions - executable (rwxrwxr-x) ✓
  3. Error handling - correct behavior when auth logs aren't readable
  4. Code review of the implementation logic

- **Key findings**:
  - Script correctly handles both Debian (`/var/log/auth.log`) and RHEL (`/var/log/secure`) systems
  - Proper regex patterns for detecting SSH failures
  - Output is sorted by count descending as required
  - Includes warning for IPs with >10 attempts
  - Provides helpful UFW blocking tip
  - Clear error message when permissions are insufficient

**Note**: Full runtime testing with actual auth log data requires sudo privileges which were not available. However, syntax validation, permission checks, error handling verification, and code review confirm the script meets all specified requirements.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Completed scripts:** `hello.py` (test), `ssh-login-detector.sh` (failed SSH login monitoring)
- **Already in Backlog:** system info script (TASK-002), disk space monitor (TASK-003), log cleanup utility (TASK-004), process memory monitor (TASK-005)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-007: Port Scanner Utility** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans common ports on localhost to show listening services
   - Complements the SSH login detector for security auditing
   - Not a duplicate: nothing in backlog covers network/port visibility

2. **TASK-008: User Login History Reporter** (LOW priority)
   - Shows successful logins, currently logged users, login sources
   - Complements TASK-006 (failed SSH detector) by tracking the "success" side
   - Not a duplicate: existing scripts focus on failures, not successful activity

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Port scanning is distinct from process/memory monitoring (TASK-005) - it focuses on network exposure, not resource usage
- Login history is the complement to failed login detection - tracking who DID get in, not just who failed
- Both fill security monitoring gaps in the current toolset

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. **Assigned TASK-003** (disk space monitor script) to developer
2. **Elevated priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - disk monitoring is important for server operations
3. **Moved task** from Backlog to In Progress section
4. **Updated timestamp** to reflect this run

**Rationale:** With no tasks currently in progress and all completed tasks verified, I selected the disk space monitor script as it's a practical operations utility that helps maintain server health. This complements the existing security-focused scripts (SSH login detector) by adding infrastructure monitoring capability.

**Next cycle:** Developer will implement the disk space monitor script. Tester will verify upon completion.

## Summary

**Completed TASK-003: Disk Space Monitor Script**

Created `/home/novakj/projects/disk-space-monitor.sh` with the following features:

- Monitors all mounted filesystems (excluding tmpfs, devtmpfs, udev, and loop devices)
- Displays usage with status indicators:
  - `[OK]` - Usage below 80%
  - `[WARNING]` - Usage 80-89%
  - `[CRITICAL]` - Usage 90% or higher
- Shows size, used, available, and mount point for each filesystem
- Provides summary count of filesystems needing attention
- No special permissions required to run

**Test output shows the server is healthy:**
- `/` at 4% (2.5G used of 72G)
- `/boot` at 8% (70M used of 989M)  
- `/boot/efi` at 6% (6.1M used of 105M)

The task has been marked as DONE and moved to the Completed section in tasks.md.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Completed scripts (3)**: hello.py, disk-space-monitor.sh, ssh-login-detector.sh
- **Backlog tasks (5)**: TASK-002 (system info), TASK-004 (log cleanup), TASK-005 (memory monitor), TASK-007 (port scanner), TASK-008 (login history)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-009: Service status checker** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Checks if key system services are running (sshd, cron, etc.)
   - Reports active/inactive/failed status
   - **Why not a duplicate**: Existing scripts monitor disk space and SSH security, but nothing checks if services themselves are running. Port scanner (TASK-007) checks listening ports, not service status via systemd.

2. **TASK-010: Network connectivity tester** (LOW priority)
   - Tests external connectivity (ping), DNS resolution, gateway reachability
   - Reports latency metrics
   - **Why not a duplicate**: Port scanner (TASK-007) focuses on *local* listening ports. This tests *outbound* connectivity and DNS, which is a different diagnostic need.

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Assigned **TASK-002** (system info script) to developer - basic utility that's foundational for server management
2. Assigned **TASK-005** (process memory monitor) to developer - complements the existing disk monitor for server health

**Reasoning:**
- No HIGH priority tasks remain (all completed and verified)
- Selected two MEDIUM priority tasks that build toward comprehensive server monitoring
- TASK-002 is simple and ensures quick progress
- TASK-005 pairs well with the already-completed disk monitor (TASK-003)

**Backlog status:**
- 5 tasks remain unassigned (TASK-004, TASK-007, TASK-008, TASK-009, TASK-010)
- Mix of LOW and MEDIUM priority items for future sprints

## Summary

I completed both tasks assigned to me:

### TASK-002: System Info Script
- **Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/system-info.sh`
- **Features**: Displays hostname, date/time, uptime, OS, kernel, CPU info (model + cores), memory usage, disk usage (root partition), load average, and logged-in user count

### TASK-005: Process Memory Monitor
- **Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/memory-monitor.sh`
- **Features**: Lists top 10 memory-consuming processes showing PID, memory in MB, and process name. Includes memory summary with usage percentage and warnings at 80%/90% thresholds

Both scripts have been tested and are working correctly. The task board has been updated to mark these tasks as DONE and moved to the Completed section.

## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **5 completed scripts**: hello.py, system-info.sh, disk-space-monitor.sh, memory-monitor.sh, ssh-login-detector.sh
- **6 pending tasks** in backlog: log cleanup, port scanner, login history, service status checker, network tester

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-011: Crontab documentation generator**
- Lists all cron jobs system-wide with human-readable schedules
- Doesn't duplicate anything - existing scripts focus on system resources and security, not scheduled task documentation

**TASK-012: System reboot history tracker**
- Shows reboot history and uptime records
- Complements system-info.sh (which shows current uptime only) by adding historical perspective
- Helps track system stability

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- No existing script documents cron jobs or scheduled tasks
- system-info.sh shows current uptime, but nothing tracks reboot history or calculates average uptime between restarts
- Both fill gaps in server administration tooling

## Summary

I completed **TASK-009: Create a service status checker**.

**Created:** `/home/novakj/projects/service-status-checker.sh`

**Features:**
- Checks critical services (ssh, cron) and optional services (systemd-timesyncd, systemd-resolved, systemd-journald, systemd-logind, networkd-dispatcher)
- Color-coded status output: `[ACTIVE]` (green), `[INACTIVE]` (yellow), `[FAILED]` (red), `[NOT FOUND]`
- Supports custom config file (`service-status-checker.conf`) for user-defined services
  - Lines starting with `!` mark critical services
  - Regular lines are optional services
- Command-line options: `-h` (help), `-c` (custom config path), `-q` (quiet mode)
- Exits with non-zero status if any critical service is down (useful for alerting/monitoring)
- Summary showing total checked, active, inactive, and failed counts

**Test run results:**
- 7 services checked
- 6 active (ssh, cron, systemd-timesyncd, systemd-resolved, systemd-journald, systemd-logind)
- 1 inactive (networkd-dispatcher - optional, not critical)
- All critical services running

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 6 completed scripts: hello world, system info, disk monitor, memory monitor, SSH login detector, service status checker
- 6 pending tasks in backlog: log cleanup, port scanner, login history, network connectivity, crontab docs, reboot history

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-013: File Permission Auditor** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans for insecure file permissions (world-writable, unusual SUID/SGID, 777/666 modes)
   - Fills a security gap - existing tools focus on network/auth logs, not filesystem permissions
   - Complements the security monitoring suite

2. **TASK-014: Package Update Checker** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Shows available updates, highlights security updates, checks if reboot needed
   - Fills a system maintenance gap - existing tools monitor runtime metrics, not package state
   - Helps maintain system hygiene with quick status checks

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- File permission auditor is security-focused but covers filesystem permissions (not covered by ssh-login-detector which checks auth logs, or port-scanner which checks network)
- Package update checker handles system maintenance/patching (no existing tool tracks package state - all current tools monitor runtime metrics like memory, disk, services)

**Current state:**
- **In Progress**: TASK-007 (port scanner) - assigned to developer
- **Backlog**: 7 tasks remaining (2 MEDIUM, 5 LOW priority)
- **Completed**: 7 verified tasks

The port scanner is a good next task as it complements the existing security tools (ssh-login-detector, service-status-checker) and helps understand what's exposed on the server.

## Summary

**Completed TASK-007: Port Scanner Utility**

Created `/home/novakj/projects/port-scanner.sh` - a script that scans localhost for listening ports and services.

**Features:**
- Scans 22 common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.)
- Color-coded output: green [OPEN], red [CLOSED]
- Multiple modes:
  - Default: shows only open ports
  - `-a`: shows all ports (open and closed)
  - `-c <ports>`: scan custom ports (comma-separated)
  - `-s`: show all listening ports via ss command
  - `-h`: help

**Test Results:**
- Syntax check passed
- Correctly detected 2 open ports: SSH (22) and DNS (53)
- All options working correctly

Task moved to Completed section in tasks.md, ready for tester verification.

   - Identifies processes running >24h or >7 days
   - Shows start time, elapsed time, CPU/memory, and command line
   - **Why it's unique**: memory-monitor.sh shows current usage but not process age; service-status-checker.sh only handles systemd services, not arbitrary processes. This adds the time dimension to process monitoring.

2. **TASK-016: Log file size analyzer** (LOW priority)
   - Analyzes log file sizes across the system
   - Reports largest files, total usage, unrotated logs
   - **Why it's unique**: Different from disk-space-monitor.sh (general disk usage) and TASK-004 log cleanup (deletion). This focuses on visibility and analysis to identify logs needing attention before they cause problems.

- 8 pending tasks in backlog: log cleanup, user login history, network tester, crontab docs, reboot tracker, package updates, long-running process detector, log file analyzer

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-017: Systemd Timer Analyzer** (Priority: LOW)
   - Lists all systemd timers with schedules and run times
   - Complements TASK-011 (crontab docs) - cron only covers traditional cron, not systemd timers
   - Modern Ubuntu uses systemd timers extensively, so this fills a visibility gap

2. **TASK-018: Swap Usage Analyzer** (Priority: LOW)
   - Monitors swap usage and identifies which processes use swap
   - Different from memory-monitor.sh which focuses on RAM/RSS usage
   - Swap analysis helps diagnose performance issues from memory pressure

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-017 is distinct from TASK-011 (crontab docs) because systemd timers are a completely different scheduling mechanism than cron
- TASK-018 is distinct from memory-monitor.sh because swap and RAM are different resources - a system can have low RAM usage but high swap usage from past memory pressure

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 10 completed scripts in `/home/novakj/projects/` covering system monitoring, security auditing, and resource management
- 9 tasks already in the backlog waiting for assignment

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-019: Configuration file backup utility** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Backs up system configs (/etc), user configs (~/.bashrc, etc.), and project configs
   - Creates timestamped tar.gz archives with retention management
   - Includes list mode and restore functionality
   - *Why it's unique*: No existing backup/disaster recovery tooling. Addresses the "Pending Tasks" item in CLAUDE.md about backup strategy.

2. **TASK-020: Git repository health checker** (Priority: LOW)
   - Dashboard view of repository status: uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, branch health
   - Identifies stale branches, large files, and common issues
   - *Why it's unique*: Goes beyond `git status` to provide comprehensive repo hygiene checks. Useful for this multi-agent system where multiple actors commit changes.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-019 (config backup) is distinct from disk-space-monitor (monitors usage vs. actively preserves files) and log-cleanup (deletes logs vs. preserves configs)
- TASK-020 (git health) is distinct from all existing tools which focus on system resources, processes, or security - this addresses source control hygiene
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/idea-maker/logs/20260119_210001.log

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-019** (Configuration file backup utility) to the developer
   - This is the only MEDIUM priority task remaining in the backlog
   - Moved it to the "In Progress" section with status IN_PROGRESS
   - This utility will help with disaster recovery by backing up important config files

2. **Updated timestamp** to reflect the assignment

The developer now has a clear task to work on. TASK-019 is a valuable utility that will backup system configs (/etc files), user configs (~/.bashrc, ~/.gitconfig), and project configs (CLAUDE.md, tasks.md) to timestamped archives with features for listing, restoring, and retention management.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-019: Create a configuration file backup utility**.

**Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/config-backup.sh`

**Features implemented**:
- **List mode** (`-l`): Shows what files would be backed up with EXISTS/MISSING status
- **Show backups** (`-s`): Displays available backup archives with sizes and creation dates
- **Restore mode** (`-r FILE`): Extracts a backup to `~/restore-TIMESTAMP` with instructions for manual restoration
- **Configurable retention** (`-n N`): Keeps last N backups (default: 5), automatically removes older ones
- **Custom backup directory** (`-d DIR`): Allows specifying alternative backup location

**Files backed up**:
- System configs: nginx, ssh, cron, apt sources, fstab, hosts, hostname
- User configs: .bashrc, .profile, .gitconfig, .ssh/config
- Project configs: CLAUDE.md, README.md, tasks.md, actor CLAUDE.md files

**Testing results**:
- Syntax check passed
- List mode correctly shows 15 files (10 system, 2 user, 3 project exist)
- Backup creation works (20K archive created)
- Show backups displays archive info correctly
- Retention/rotation removes oldest backups when limit exceeded

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- **10 CLI scripts** in `/home/novakj/projects/` (system monitoring, security auditing, backups)
- **10 backlog tasks** - mostly CLI utilities (log cleanup, network testing, process monitoring, etc.)
- **Static web dashboard** at cronloop.techtools.cz with hardcoded agent/task info

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-021: Real-time Task Board Viewer** (HIGH priority)
   - Kanban-style web page showing Backlog/In Progress/Completed columns
   - Parses tasks.md and displays tasks as color-coded cards
   - Why it's unique: The current dashboard shows just "12 completed" - this provides a full interactive view of all tasks

2. **TASK-022: Agent Execution Log Viewer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Web page to browse and view agent logs without SSH
   - Filter by agent type (idea-maker, PM, developer, tester)
   - Why it's unique: Different from TASK-016 (CLI log size analyzer) - this is a web UI for viewing log contents

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- All existing backlog items are CLI scripts/utilities, not web app features
- The current web dashboard is static with hardcoded values - these tasks add dynamic data display
- TASK-021 transforms the dashboard from a static display into a functional project management tool
- TASK-022 provides web-based log visibility, distinct from the CLI-based log analyzer in TASK-016

## Summary

**Assigned TASK-021** (Kanban task board viewer) to developer.

This is the highest priority task in the backlog - a web app feature that will display tasks.md in an interactive Kanban-style layout on the CronLoop dashboard. The developer should create cards color-coded by priority (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray) with Backlog, In Progress, and Completed columns.

**Next up:** TASK-022 (log viewer page) is MEDIUM priority and ready for assignment once TASK-021 is complete.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-021: Add real-time task board viewer to CronLoop web app**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/tasks.html`** - A new Kanban-style task board page with:
   - Three columns: Backlog, In Progress, Completed
   - Task cards with priority color-coding (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray border)
   - Priority badges and assignee icons on each card
   - Task counts displayed in stats bar and column headers
   - JavaScript that fetches and parses tasks.md to render tasks dynamically
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
   - Responsive design for mobile devices
   - Navigation link back to main dashboard

2. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Made the Tasks card clickable to navigate to the task board
   - Added JavaScript to dynamically count completed tasks from tasks.md

3. **Configured Nginx** to serve tasks.md (added `disable_symlinks off` directive)

4. **Copied tasks.md** to web root for fetch access

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/tasks.html

The task board now provides a visual project management view showing all tasks from tasks.md organized by status, with 11 backlog tasks, 0 in progress, and 12 completed tasks displayed.

## Summary

### Existing Features Found:
**Web App:**
- Main dashboard (`index.html`) with agent pipeline display, stats cards, system info
- Kanban task board (`tasks.html`) - completed as TASK-021

**Backlog (13 pending tasks):**
- Various CLI utilities (log cleanup, login history, network tester, cron docs, reboot tracker, process detector, log analyzer, systemd timer analyzer, swap analyzer, git health checker)
- 1 web feature: Agent log viewer (TASK-022)

**Completed (15 tasks):**
- Task board viewer, config backup, package update checker, file permission auditor, port scanner, service status checker, system info, memory monitor, disk space monitor, SSH login detector, and hello world script

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-023: System Health Dashboard Page (MEDIUM priority)**
- Web app page showing real-time server metrics: CPU, memory, disk, load average, uptime
- Visual gauges and warning colors for threshold breaches
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Different from existing CLI scripts - brings monitoring data to the web UI
- Different from TASK-022 (log viewer) which focuses on agent logs

**TASK-024: JSON API Endpoint Script (LOW priority)**
- Shell script outputting system metrics in JSON format
- Companion to TASK-023 for data fetching
- Enables web dashboard to display live server data
- Different from existing scripts which output human-readable text

### Why These Don't Duplicate:
- No existing web health dashboard page
- No JSON API output from existing scripts
- TASK-022 covers agent logs (different domain)
- CLI scripts (system-info.sh, memory-monitor.sh, disk-space-monitor.sh) output human text, not JSON for web consumption
- These tasks extend the web app's functionality in a new direction (system monitoring)

## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Action Taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-024** (Create JSON API endpoint script for system metrics) to the developer
- Elevated priority from LOW to MEDIUM since it's a prerequisite for TASK-023 (system health dashboard)

**Rationale:**
With TASK-021 (task board viewer) now complete and verified, the next logical web app feature is the system health dashboard (TASK-023). However, TASK-024 (JSON API) is a dependency that needs to be built first. The developer should create the JSON API endpoint so the dashboard page can consume real system metrics.

**Current State:**
- 1 task assigned (TASK-024 - developer)
- 2 MEDIUM priority web app tasks remain (TASK-022 log viewer, TASK-023 health dashboard)
- 11 LOW priority utility scripts in backlog

## Summary

I completed **TASK-024: Create JSON API endpoint script for system metrics**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/home/novakj/projects/system-metrics-api.sh`** - A shell script that outputs system metrics in JSON format with:
   - `hostname` - Server hostname
   - `timestamp` - ISO 8601 formatted timestamp
   - `uptime` - Human-readable uptime string and seconds
   - `memory` - used_mb, available_mb, total_mb, percent
   - `disk` - Array of partitions with mount, used_gb, total_gb, percent
   - `cpu` - cores, load_1m, load_5m, load_15m
   - `services` - Status of ssh, nginx, cron (running/stopped)

2. **Options:**
   - `-o FILE` - Write output to a file
   - `-c` - CGI mode with HTTP Content-Type and CORS headers
   - `-h` - Help message

3. **Deployed to web app:**
   - Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/` directory
   - JSON available at `https://cronloop.techtools.cz/api/system-metrics.json`

4. **Automated refresh:**
   - Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-metrics.sh`
   - Added cron job to refresh metrics every minute

5. **Tested:**
   - Valid JSON output verified with Python json.tool
   - API endpoint accessible via HTTPS

The API is now ready for **TASK-023** (system health dashboard) to consume.

- **Web App**: Dashboard (index.html) with agent pipeline and stats, Kanban task board (tasks.html), JSON API for metrics
- **12 Completed Tasks**: Various CLI utilities (system info, disk monitor, memory monitor, port scanner, SSH detector, etc.)
- **12 Backlog Tasks**: Including log viewer (TASK-022), system health dashboard (TASK-023), and various CLI utilities

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-025: Dark/Light Theme Toggle** (LOW priority)
   - Adds accessibility and user preference support
   - Leverages existing CSS variables for easy implementation
   - Not a duplicate - no existing UI/UX improvement tasks

2. **TASK-026: GitHub Commit Activity Feed** (LOW priority)
   - Shows recent commits from the repository on the web dashboard
   - Uses GitHub's public API
   - Not a duplicate - TASK-020 is a CLI script for local repo health, this is a web widget for viewing remote commit history

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Theme toggle is a UI/UX feature, no existing tasks address visual customization
- GitHub feed is distinct from TASK-020 (CLI-based local git analysis) and TASK-022 (agent execution logs) - this shows commit history via GitHub API

### Existing Features Found:
- **Web App Pages**: Dashboard (index.html), Task Board (tasks.html), Health Dashboard (health.html), System Metrics API
- **Backlog**: 13 tasks already queued including 3 web app features (log viewer, dark theme, GitHub commits)
- **Completed**: 14 tasks verified, including CLI monitoring scripts and 3 web app features

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-027: Real-time agent activity indicator (MEDIUM priority)**
- Makes the Agent Pipeline section dynamic instead of static "Idle" labels
- Shows which agent is currently running with live updates
- Displays "Last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents
- Not a duplicate: TASK-022 shows historical logs, this shows LIVE status

**TASK-028: Cron execution timeline page (LOW priority)**
- Visual timeline of cron orchestrator runs
- Success/failure indicators with color coding
- Shows which agents ran in each cycle
- Not a duplicate: Different from log viewer (TASK-022) which shows individual log contents - this shows high-level orchestrator execution history as a timeline

Both ideas are web app features that add real-time monitoring capabilities to the dashboard, following the rule that all new features must be integrated into the web interface.

**Project Manager Summary:**

**Action taken:** Assigned TASK-027 (Real-time agent activity indicator) to the developer.

**Rationale:**
- This is the highest impact MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
- Transforms the static Agent Pipeline section into a live monitoring feature
- Requires both backend (cron-orchestrator.sh modifications) and frontend (JavaScript polling) work
- Will show which agent is running, elapsed time, and "last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents
- Aligns with the primary focus on improving the CronLoop web app

**Backlog status:**
- 16 tasks remaining in backlog (1 MEDIUM: TASK-022 log viewer, 15 LOW priority)
- TASK-022 (agent log viewer) is the next MEDIUM priority candidate for future assignment
- LOW priority tasks are mostly standalone CLI scripts that need web integration consideration

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-027: Add real-time agent activity indicator to CronLoop dashboard**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-agent-status.sh`** - A helper script that updates agent status in JSON format using Python for atomic updates

2. **Modified `/home/novakj/scripts/cron-orchestrator.sh`** - Added calls to update agent status when each agent starts (running) and finishes (completed/error), plus orchestrator start/end tracking

3. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-status.json`** - JSON file structure with:
   - `orchestrator_running` flag
   - `orchestrator_started` timestamp  
   - `current_agent` pointer
   - Per-agent status (status, last_run, last_completed, message)

4. **Enhanced `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** with:
   - CSS animations: `agent-pulse` keyframe for running agents with blue glow effect
   - Status badge classes: `status-running`, `status-completed`, `status-error`
   - Orchestrator status bar with pulsing dot indicator
   - JavaScript polling every 5 seconds with cache-busting
   - `timeAgo()` function for "Last run: Xm ago" display
   - `elapsedTime()` function for "Running Xm Ys" on active agents
   - Added Security agent (5th agent) to dashboard
   - Updated agent count from 4 to 5

## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-027: Add real-time agent activity indicator to CronLoop dashboard**.

**Result: PASS**

### What Was Tested

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: Dashboard (index.html) returns HTTP 200 at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/
2. **Agent Status JSON API**: `/api/agent-status.json` returns valid JSON with correct structure
3. **update-agent-status.sh Script**: 
   - Syntax validation passed
   - Usage/help display works
   - Invalid agent error handling works (exit code 1)
   - Status update flow verified (running → completed)
4. **cron-orchestrator.sh Integration**: All 5 agents have update_status calls
5. **Dashboard HTML**: All 5 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, tester, security) have data-agent attributes
6. **CSS Animations**: agent-pulse keyframes, status badge classes, orchestrator status bar
7. **JavaScript Functions**: timeAgo(), elapsedTime(), updateAgentCard(), updateOrchestratorStatus(), loadAgentStatus()
8. **Polling**: 5-second interval with cache-busting (?t=Date.now())
9. **Web Integration**: Feature fully accessible via browser

### Key Findings

- The implementation correctly transforms the static dashboard into a live monitoring system
- Status updates flow properly from orchestrator → update script → JSON file → JavaScript → UI
- All 5 agents are tracked with status, last_run, last_completed, and message fields
- CSS animations provide visual feedback for running agents (blue pulse/glow effect)
- Error handling is robust with proper exit codes

The task has been marked as **VERIFIED** in tasks.md.

Security review completed. Here's the summary:

## Security Review Summary - 2026-01-19

### Critical Issues Fixed (1)
- **Nginx security hardening**: Added rules to block access to sensitive file types (`.git`, `.env`, `.sh`, `.py`, `.log`, `CLAUDE.md`)

### Verified Secure
- No secrets/credentials in git history
- Sensitive files (`CLAUDE.md`, `tasks.md`, `.ssh/`) have correct permissions
- No world-writable files in web root
- No symlinks in web root pointing to sensitive directories
- HTTPS/SSL properly configured

### Ongoing Concerns (Monitoring)
- **SSH Brute Force Activity**: Detected 258+ failed login attempts from 94.26.106.110 and multiple other IPs
  - Recommendation: Install `fail2ban` to auto-block attackers
  - Recommendation: Configure UFW firewall with rate limiting

### Web Security Test Results
| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `/.git/config` | 404 (blocked) |
| `/.env` | 404 (blocked) |
| `/CLAUDE.md` | 404 (blocked) |
| `/tasks.md` | 200 (allowed for task viewer) |
| `/index.html` | 200 (OK) |
| `/tasks.html` | 200 (OK) |
| `/health.html` | 200 (OK) |

**Status: SECURE** - All critical issues resolved, system hardened.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- **Web App Pages:** Main dashboard (index.html), task board (tasks.html), health dashboard (health.html)
- **API Endpoints:** agent-status.json, system-metrics.json
- **CLI Tools:** 12 utility scripts covering system info, disk, memory, ports, services, security auditing, backups, package updates
- **Backlog:** 14 pending tasks covering log viewer, theme toggle, GitHub feed, timeline, plus various CLI utilities

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-029: Mobile PWA Support** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Makes dashboard installable as a mobile app
   - Adds offline caching via service worker
   - Enables monitoring on the go without browser
   - Different from theme toggle (visual only) - this adds app-like capabilities

2. **TASK-030: Browser Notification Alerts** (LOW priority)
   - Proactive alerts when errors occur or health goes critical
   - Works in background tabs
   - Rate-limited to prevent spam
   - Different from all existing read-only dashboards - this adds proactive monitoring

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- PWA support is a new capability not covered by any existing task (theme toggle is visual, responsive design is layout)
- Browser notifications add a completely new dimension of proactive monitoring not addressed by any existing feature or task
- Both enhance the user experience for remote monitoring without requiring SSH access

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of PM Actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-022** (Agent execution log viewer page) to the developer
   - This is a MEDIUM priority web app feature
   - Provides visibility into agent activity through the web browser
   - Complements the existing real-time agent status indicator (TASK-027) by showing historical log contents
   - Updated notes to include the security agent in the filter list

**Current Queue:**
- **For Developer**: TASK-022 (Agent log viewer page) - ready to work on
- **Remaining Backlog**: 13 unassigned tasks (mostly LOW priority CLI utilities)

**Rationale:** TASK-022 is the most valuable unassigned web feature remaining. It directly supports the CronLoop dashboard's purpose by letting users view agent execution logs without SSH access, transforming the dashboard into a more complete monitoring solution.

>>> Running Developer Agent...
## Summary

I've completed **TASK-022: Add agent execution log viewer page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/logs.html`** - Log viewer page with:
   - Agent tab filters (All, Idea Maker, Project Manager, Developer, Tester, Security)
   - Per-agent log counts in tab badges
   - Log entries showing: agent badge (color-coded), filename, relative timestamp, file size, preview text
   - Modal popup to view full log content with syntax highlighting
   - Auto-refresh every 2 minutes
   - Responsive design for mobile

2. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-logs-index.sh`** - Script to generate JSON index of log files with:
   - Timestamps extracted from filenames
   - File sizes
   - Content previews (first 200 chars of meaningful content)

3. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/sync-logs-to-web.sh`** - Script to:
   - Copy recent logs (last 20 per agent) to web-accessible directory
   - Clean up old files
   - Update the logs index JSON

4. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/logs-index.json`** - JSON API endpoint with log metadata

5. **Updated nginx config** - Added rule to allow serving `.log` files from `/logs/` path while blocking them elsewhere

6. **Added cron job** - Syncs logs to web every 2 minutes

7. **Updated main dashboard** (`index.html`) - Added Logs card with total log count and link to log viewer

### Live at:
- Log Viewer: https://cronloop.techtools.cz/logs.html
- Logs API: https://cronloop.techtools.cz/api/logs-index.json
- Dashboard: https://cronloop.techtools.cz (with new Logs card)

## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-022: Add agent execution log viewer page to CronLoop web app** and marked it as **VERIFIED**.

### Test Results: PASS

**What was tested:**

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: logs.html returns HTTP 200 at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/logs.html

2. **JSON API**: /api/logs-index.json returns HTTP 200 with valid JSON structure containing:
   - timestamp field
   - agents array with 5 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, tester, security)
   - Each agent has logs array with filename, path, timestamp, size, and preview fields

3. **Supporting Scripts**:
   - `update-logs-index.sh` - syntax check passed, executable permissions correct
   - `sync-logs-to-web.sh` - syntax check passed, executable permissions correct

4. **Cron Job**: `*/2 * * * *` schedule syncs logs every 2 minutes

5. **Log File Serving**: Direct fetch of log files returns HTTP 200 with correct content

6. **Nginx Configuration**: Custom location rule allows .log files from /logs/ path with proper Content-Type header

7. **Dashboard Integration**: Main dashboard includes "Logs" card linking to logs.html

8. **Agent Tab Filters**: 6 tabs (All Agents + 5 individual) with count badges

9. **Log Entry Rendering**: Proper HTML generation with XSS prevention via escapeHtml()

10. **Modal Functionality**: Opens log content, applies syntax highlighting, closes on button/overlay/Escape

11. **Auto-refresh**: Polls every 2 minutes with cache-busting

12. **Responsive Design**: Mobile layout rules at 768px breakpoint

**Verdict**: Excellent implementation providing full visibility into agent activity through the browser. All features work as specified.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (at cronloop.techtools.cz):**
- `index.html` - Main dashboard with real-time agent activity indicator, system stats
- `tasks.html` - Kanban-style task board (Backlog/In Progress/Completed)
- `logs.html` - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- `health.html` - System health dashboard (CPU, memory, disk, services)
- JSON APIs in `/api/` directory

**CLI Tools (in /home/novakj/projects/):**
- 12 utility scripts including: system-info, disk-space-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, file-permission-auditor, service-status-checker, package-update-checker, config-backup, system-metrics-api

**Backlog Already Has 15 Tasks:**
- CLI utilities: log cleanup, login history, network tester, crontab docs, reboot tracker, process detector, log size analyzer, systemd timer analyzer, swap analyzer, git health checker
- Web features: theme toggle, GitHub commits feed, cron timeline, PWA support, browser notifications

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-031: Quick Actions Panel** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Transforms the dashboard from read-only to interactive control panel
   - Buttons to trigger: health check, metrics refresh, log cleanup, log sync
   - Backend queue system processed by cron
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - **Why unique**: All existing web features are read-only displays; this adds interactive control without SSH

2. **TASK-032: Security Audit Dashboard** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Consolidates security data from existing CLI tools into a single web page
   - Shows: SSH brute force attempts, open ports, permission issues, security updates
   - Overall security score/status indicator
   - Companion script to generate security-metrics.json
   - **Why unique**: Different from health.html (performance), logs.html (all agents), and CLI security tools (require SSH). Brings security visibility to the web UI

Both ideas follow the web integration rule - they create browser-accessible features at cronloop.techtools.cz rather than standalone scripts.

>>> Running Project Manager Agent...
**Summary of PM Actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-032** (Security audit dashboard) to developer
2. **Elevated priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - The security status section shows SSH brute force attacks have escalated to 3,671 attempts. A security audit dashboard in the web UI will provide critical visibility into security events without requiring SSH access.

**Rationale:**
- The security actor has flagged urgent SSH brute force activity (3,671 failed attempts)
- TASK-032 brings security monitoring to the web interface, complementing existing security CLI tools
- It aggregates data from ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, file-permission-auditor, and package-update-checker into a single web view
- This addresses the "Web Integration Rule" - making security data visible in the browser

**Developer Queue:** TASK-032 is now ready for implementation.

## Summary of Implementation

**Created Files:**

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/security-metrics.sh`** - Shell script that consolidates security data from existing tools into JSON:
   - Extracts SSH brute force data from auth.log (total attempts, unique IPs, top 5 attackers)
   - Scans open ports using `ss` command
   - Checks file permissions (world-writable, 777/666 files)
   - Gets package update counts (total, security, reboot status)
   - Verifies nginx security rules (.git, .env, .log blocking)
   - Calculates overall security score (0-100)
   - Generates recommendations based on issues found

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/security.html`** - Security dashboard page with:
   - Security Score hero section (score + Secure/Warning/Critical status)
   - SSH Brute Force card (10,918 attempts detected, 81 unique IPs, top 5 attackers listed)
   - Open Ports card (4 ports: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS)
   - Package Updates card (66 total, 39 security updates)
   - File Permissions card (0 issues found)
   - Nginx Security card (verifies blocking rules)
   - Recommendations section with severity-coded actionable items
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

3. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** - Added Security card to main dashboard showing score and link

4. **Added cron job** - Updates security metrics every 5 minutes

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/security.html

The dashboard shows a current security score of **40 (Critical)** due to:
- 10,918 SSH brute force attempts (ongoing attack)
- 39 security package updates available

>>> Running Security Agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**

**SECURE:**
- Nginx correctly blocks sensitive files (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md)
- HTTP tests confirm CLAUDE.md and .git return 404
- File permissions correct: .ssh/ is 700, id_ed25519 is 600
- No world-writable files in web root
- No symlinks pointing outside web root
- No secrets in git history or web files
- Disk usage healthy at 4%

**CRITICAL CONCERN - SSH Brute Force:**
- 4,041 failed login attempts (up 370 from last check)
- 10 top attacker IPs with 138-305 attempts each
- 84+ unique attacking IPs total
- Attack is **escalating** - not being mitigated

**IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. `sudo apt install fail2ban -y` - auto-block repeat offenders
2. `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh` - enable firewall with rate limiting

The system's web security is solid, but the SSH brute force attack continues unabated because fail2ban and UFW are not active. This should be addressed urgently by the system administrator.

I have completed **TASK-031: Add quick actions panel to CronLoop dashboard**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Implementation Summary

**Quick Actions Panel** - Transforms the CronLoop dashboard from a read-only monitoring tool into an interactive control panel.

### Components Created:

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/action-processor.sh`** - Processes queued actions from JSON queue file
   - Supports 6 action types: health_check, refresh_metrics, sync_logs, cleanup_logs, update_security, git_status
   - Tracks action status (pending/running/completed/error)
   - Logs action execution to `/home/novakj/logs/actions/`

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/queue-action.sh`** - Adds actions to the queue
   - Rate limiting (1 action per type per minute)
   - Validates action types
   - Prevents duplicate queued actions

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/action.cgi`** - CGI endpoint for web app
   - Queue actions via `?action=<type>`
   - Check status without parameters

4. **JSON API files:**
   - `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-queue.json` - Pending actions
   - `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/action-status.json` - Action results

5. **Dashboard UI** - Added Quick Actions section with 6 buttons:
   - Health Check, Refresh Metrics, Sync Logs, Cleanup Logs, Security Scan, Git Status
   - Loading spinner, success/error states
   - Real-time status polling

6. **Infrastructure:**
   - Installed and configured fcgiwrap for CGI support
   - Cron job runs action processor every minute

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz (Quick Actions section between Agent Pipeline and System Info)

>>> Running Tester Agent...
## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-031: Add quick actions panel to CronLoop dashboard** and marked it as **VERIFIED** with a **[PASS]** status.

### What was tested:

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: Dashboard returns HTTP 200 at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/
2. **JSON APIs**: Both `/api/action-queue.json` and `/api/action-status.json` return valid JSON
3. **Scripts**: Both `action-processor.sh` (201 lines) and `queue-action.sh` (119 lines) pass bash syntax validation and have correct permissions
4. **CGI Endpoint**: `/cgi-bin/action.cgi` exists and is properly configured in nginx with fcgiwrap
5. **Action Queueing**: Successfully queues actions with unique IDs, validates action types, handles missing arguments
6. **Rate Limiting**: 60-second cooldown per action type works correctly (tested by trying to queue same action twice)
7. **Action Processing**: Queued actions are properly processed - moved from pending to processing to completed
8. **Cron Job**: Configured to run every minute (`* * * * *`)
9. **Action Logs**: Stored in `/home/novakj/logs/actions/` with timestamped filenames
10. **Dashboard UI**: Quick Actions section has 6 buttons with proper CSS states (loading, success, error)
11. **JavaScript**: `triggerAction()`, `pollActionStatus()`, and `loadActionStatus()` functions work correctly
12. **Security**: Pre-defined action types only, no arbitrary command execution

### Key findings:
- All 6 action types work: health_check, refresh_metrics, sync_logs, cleanup_logs, update_security, git_status
- Status auto-clears after 5s (success) or 10s (error) as documented
- The implementation transforms the dashboard from read-only monitoring to an interactive control panel

Security review completed. Summary of findings:

**Status: NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Checks Passed:**
- nginx blocks sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return 404
- Sensitive files have correct permissions (.ssh/ is 700, id_ed25519 is 600)
- No secrets or credentials in git history
- No symlinks in web root pointing outside web directory
- CGI action system uses whitelist validation (safe - no arbitrary command execution)
- Disk usage healthy at 4%

**Warnings:**
1. **SSH Brute Force Ongoing**: 4,424 failed login attempts from 92 unique IPs (+383 since last check)
   - Top attackers: 164.92.216.111 (348), 66.116.226.147 (305), 94.26.106.110 (258)

2. **World-writable API files**: `action-queue.json` and `action-status.json` have 666 permissions
   - Required for CGI script to write
   - Risk assessed as low: only contains action status data, no secrets
   - Mitigated by whitelist validation (only 6 predefined action types accepted)

**Critical Security Gaps:**
- fail2ban NOT INSTALLED
- UFW firewall INACTIVE

**Recommendations:**
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh
```

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- Web app has 5 pages: index.html (dashboard), tasks.html (Kanban board), health.html (system metrics), logs.html (agent log viewer), security.html (security audit dashboard)
- 17 tasks already in Backlog covering: log cleanup, login history, network testing, cron documentation, reboot tracking, process detection, log analysis, systemd timers, swap monitoring, git health, theme toggle, GitHub commits, cron timeline, PWA support, notifications, global search, documentation page
- 12 projects/scripts already exist in /home/novakj/projects/

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-035: System Resource Comparison/Trends Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks historical resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) over time
   - Shows trends and comparisons: "now vs 1 hour ago vs 1 day ago"
   - Uses sparkline charts for visual trends
   - Different from health dashboard (point-in-time) - this adds historical analysis
   - Helps catch slow resource degradation before it becomes critical

2. **TASK-036: Agent Performance Analytics Page** (LOW priority)
   - Aggregates agent performance statistics (success rates, execution times)
   - Shows per-agent metrics and productivity trends
   - Different from log viewer (raw content) - this provides statistical analysis
   - Different from cron timeline (execution history) - this provides metrics/analytics
   - Helps identify underperforming agents

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-035 fills the gap between current-state monitoring (health.html) and historical tracking - nothing currently shows resource TRENDS over time
- TASK-036 provides agent ANALYTICS vs raw logs (logs.html) or real-time status (index.html) - no existing task aggregates agent performance statistics

## Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-035** (System Resource Trends Page) to the developer
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Moved from Backlog to In Progress section
   - Added assignment note with rationale

**Rationale for selection:**
- TASK-035 is a MEDIUM priority web feature (higher value than LOW priority items)
- Builds on existing infrastructure (system-metrics.json API already exists from TASK-024)
- Adds historical trend analysis to complement the point-in-time health dashboard
- High value for proactive monitoring - helps identify slow resource degradation before it becomes critical
- All web-focused tasks were prioritized per PM guidelines

**Current state:**
- **Backlog**: 16 unassigned tasks (4 MEDIUM, 12 LOW priority)
- **In Progress**: 1 task (TASK-035 assigned to developer)
- **Completed**: 19 verified tasks

I've completed TASK-035. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-035: System Resource Trends Page - Completed

**Created files:**

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/collect-metrics-snapshot.sh`** - Data collection script that:
   - Collects memory, CPU load, disk usage metrics
   - Stores snapshots in JSON format with auto-rotation
   - Keeps last 7 days (672 entries at 15-min intervals)

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/metrics-history.json`** - Historical data store

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/trends.html`** - Trends visualization page with:
   - **Memory Usage** card with sparkline SVG chart
   - **CPU Load** card with 1-minute load average sparkline
   - **Disk Usage** card for root partition
   - **Load Ratio** card (load/cores)
   - Comparison grids: "Now vs 1 Hour Ago vs 1 Day Ago" with color-coded differences
   - Trend badges (Rising/Falling/Stable)
   - Trend Alerts section for critical/warning conditions
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

4. **Updated main dashboard** (`index.html`) with Trends card linking to trends.html

5. **Cron job** added: `*/15 * * * *` runs data collection every 15 minutes

## Testing Complete

I tested **TASK-035: Add system resource comparison/trends page to CronLoop web app** and marked it as **VERIFIED**.

### Summary

**Test Result: PASS**

**What was tested:**
1. **HTTP accessibility** - trends.html returns HTTP 200 (36,860 bytes)
2. **JSON API** - /api/metrics-history.json returns valid JSON with 8 snapshots
3. **Backend script** - collect-metrics-snapshot.sh passes syntax check, has correct permissions, and executes successfully
4. **Data structure** - JSON contains proper timestamp, epoch, memory, cpu, and disk metrics
5. **Cron job** - `*/15 * * * *` schedule confirmed for data collection
6. **All 4 metric cards** - Memory, CPU Load, Disk Usage, Load Ratio with sparklines, min/max values, and comparison grids
7. **Trend badges** - Rising/Falling/Stable based on 5% threshold
8. **Trend alerts** - Properly triggers for critical/high memory, disk, and CPU conditions
9. **XSS prevention** - escapeHtml() function applied to dynamic content
10. **Auto-refresh** - 60-second interval with cache-busting
11. **Insufficient data handling** - Shows "Collecting Data..." when <4 snapshots
12. **Dashboard integration** - Trends card with snapshot count links to trends.html
13. **Responsive design** - Mobile layout at 768px breakpoint

**Key implementation highlights:**
- Sparkline SVG charts generated dynamically from historical data
- Purple color theme differentiates from health page (green)
- Embedded Python for safe JSON manipulation (avoids jq edge cases)
- 7-day retention with automatic rotation (max 672 entries)
- Comparison grids show Now vs 1 Hour Ago vs 1 Day Ago with color-coded differences

Excellent implementation providing historical trend analysis with visual sparklines, comparison grids, and proactive alerting for concerning patterns.

Security review completed. Here's the summary:

## Security Review Summary - 2026-01-20 01:12 UTC

### Status: NEEDS ATTENTION

**Checks Passed:**
- ✅ Nginx blocks sensitive files (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return HTTP 404
- ✅ Sensitive file permissions correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, id_ed25519: 600)
- ✅ No secrets/credentials in git history
- ✅ No symlinks in web root pointing outside
- ✅ No embedded secrets in JavaScript/HTML
- ✅ CGI action validation uses whitelist (safe)
- ✅ Disk usage healthy (4%)

**Warnings:**
- ⚠️ World-writable API files (action-queue.json, action-status.json) - required for CGI, low risk
- ⚠️ tasks.md in web root (intentional for task viewer, no secrets)

**Critical Security Gaps:**
- 🔴 **SSH Brute Force Escalating**: 4,785 failed attempts from 118 unique IPs (+8% increase, 26 new attackers)
- 🔴 **fail2ban NOT INSTALLED** - attackers not being blocked
- 🔴 **UFW INACTIVE** - no rate limiting on SSH

**Top Attackers:**
1. 164.92.216.111 (377 attempts) - PERSISTENT
2. 66.116.226.147 (327 attempts) - PERSISTENT
3. 94.26.106.110 (258 attempts) - PERSISTENT

**Urgent Recommendations:**
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh
```

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz):**
- `index.html` - Main dashboard with agent status, quick actions, system overview
- `tasks.html` - Kanban-style task board viewer
- `logs.html` - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- `health.html` - System health dashboard (CPU, memory, disk)
- `security.html` - Security audit dashboard
- `trends.html` - System resource trends/history with sparklines

**CLI Scripts in /home/novakj/projects/:**
- 13 utility scripts (system-info, disk-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, service-status-checker, file-permission-auditor, package-update-checker, config-backup, system-metrics-api)

**Backlog already contains:** 18 pending tasks covering themes like theme toggle, GitHub commits, PWA support, notifications, search, documentation, and analytics.

---

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-037: Backup Status Dashboard Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates `/backups.html` showing backup overview
   - Displays last backup date, size, and available archives
   - Integrates with existing `config-backup.sh` script
   - "Create Backup Now" button via Quick Actions
   - **Why unique**: CLI backup tool exists but no web visibility into backup status

2. **TASK-038: Agent Conversation Viewer Page** (LOW priority)
   - Creates `/conversations.html` with chat-bubble format
   - Parses agent logs to show Claude's reasoning and tool calls
   - Searchable and filterable by agent/date
   - **Why unique**: logs.html shows raw log files; this PARSES them into readable conversations showing what Claude thought and did
