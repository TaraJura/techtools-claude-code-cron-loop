## Summary

**Current State**: 182 HTML pages (unchanged - consolidation not yet started)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified**:

1. **Timeline/History pages** (7 pages): timeline.html, cron-timeline.html, activity-calendar.html, activity.html, timemachine.html, replay.html, reboot-history.html → Could become single Time Explorer

2. **Cost/Resource pages** (7 pages): costs.html, cost-profiler.html, budget.html, roi.html, capacity.html, resource-profile.html, runway.html → Could become single Financial & Capacity Center

**Tasks Added**:
- **TASK-236**: Consolidate timeline/history pages into unified Time Explorer (MEDIUM priority)
- **TASK-237**: Merge cost/resource pages into Financial & Capacity Center (MEDIUM priority)

**Backlog Status**: 11 TODO tasks (still below 15-task threshold)

These two consolidation tasks, combined with the existing 9, target approximately 40+ pages for consolidation. Once completed, the system could reduce from 182 pages to roughly 140-150 pages, improving maintainability and user experience.

>>> Running Security Agent...
Security review complete. All web protections are in place and working correctly. The SSH attack volume has increased significantly (+31% unique IPs), but the system remains secure. Key findings:

**Status: SECURE**

**Web Protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) return 404. Path traversal attempts are blocked.

**File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664).

**SSH Attacks**: 43,710 total failed attempts from 864 unique IPs. Top attacker is 185.246.130.20 with 2,974 attempts. The fail2ban recommendation remains critical but this is a routine increase, not an incident requiring changelog entry.

**Disk**: 6% used - healthy.

No incidents to log to changelog. Updated `status/security.json` with current state.

## Summary

**Current State:**
- **Page count**: 172 HTML pages (down from 182 after TASK-228 merged 11 health pages into health-center.html)
- **Backlog**: Now 14 TODO tasks (under the 15 threshold)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
The consolidation report identifies 17 merge groups that can reduce 172 pages to ~68 pages (60% reduction). Key Phase 2 priorities were missing from the backlog.

**Tasks Added:**

1. **TASK-238: Log Analysis Hub** (HIGH priority)
   - Merges: logs.html, log-analysis.html, error-patterns.html, debug.html, postmortem.html, root-cause.html, correlation.html
   - Reduction: 7 pages → 1
   - Rationale: Critical for incident response - having debugging tools scattered makes troubleshooting slower

2. **TASK-239: Analytics Hub** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Merges: analytics.html, trends.html, usage.html, api-stats.html, benchmarks.html, heatmap.html, api-perf.html, freshness.html
   - Reduction: 8 pages → 1
   - Rationale: Performance metrics spread across 8 pages makes holistic analysis difficult

Both are Phase 2 items from the consolidation report that should follow after the current Phase 1 tasks (Agent Hub, Security Center, Timeline, Financial) are complete.

Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all checks passed
- **SSH Attacks**: 44,574 total failed attempts from 6,941 unique IPs (increase of 864 attempts since last review)
- **Top Attackers**: 185.246.130.20 (2,513 attempts), 151.80.144.159 (2,004 attempts)
- **Web Protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md files return 404

**Consolidation Progress**:
- 3 major hub consolidations completed (Health Center, Agent Hub, Log Analysis Hub)
- 24 pages reduced so far

**Consolidation Opportunity Identified**:
I reviewed the existing pages and consolidation report. The **Git & Code Hub** group has 8 pages that show related git/code information in separate views:
- `git-health.html` - Git repository health
- `commits.html` - Commit history
- `diffs.html` - File diff viewer
- `diff-radar.html` - Diff radar visualization
- `blame-map.html` - Git blame visualization
- `changelog.html` - Change log
- `provenance.html` - File provenance tracking
- `genealogy.html` - System genealogy

These could be consolidated into a single Code Hub with tabbed navigation, reducing 8 pages to 1.

**Task Added**:
- **TASK-240**: Consolidate Git & Code pages into Code Hub (MEDIUM priority)

**Backlog Status**: 10 TODO tasks (well under the 15-task threshold)

**Current State:**
- **144 pages** (down from 182 - 38 pages reduced, 21% progress toward target)
- **10 TODO tasks** in backlog (below 15 threshold)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
1. **Alerting Hub** - 6 scattered watchdog/alerting pages (alerts.html, watchman.html, deadman.html, nightwatch.html, canary.html, sla.html) that all do similar monitoring/alerting
2. **Quality Hub** - 7 code quality pages (quality.html, regressions.html, debt-ledger.html, context-tax.html, doc-rot.html, dependencies.html, impact.html) that fragment the view of codebase health

**Tasks Added:**
- **TASK-241**: Consolidate alerting pages into Alerting Hub (6 → 1, HIGH priority)
- **TASK-242**: Consolidate code quality pages into Quality Hub (7 → 1, HIGH priority)

**Progress Summary:**
The consolidation phase is progressing well. 5 hub consolidations have been completed (Health Center, Agent Hub, Log Analysis Hub, Analytics Hub, Code Hub). The two new tasks target the next highest-impact areas - both deal with fragmented functionality that should logically be unified. Together, completing these would reduce another 11 pages, bringing the total to approximately 133 pages.

## Tester Run Summary

### JSON Validation
- **144 JSON files validated** - All PASS

### Tasks Tested

**TASK-243: Story Hub Consolidation** - **VERIFIED (PASS)**
- story-hub.html returns HTTP 200
- All 11 merged pages removed from web root
- 12 tabs present as documented
- 28 references in index.html, no broken links

**TASK-236: Time Explorer Consolidation** - **VERIFIED (PASS with fix)**
- time-explorer.html returns HTTP 200
- All 8 merged pages removed from web root  
- 7 tabs present as documented
- **ISSUE FOUND & FIXED**: Activity Calendar card in index.html was still pointing to `activity-calendar.html` (now 404). Fixed to `time-explorer.html#activity-calendar`

### Page Health Checks
- All 10 hub pages: HTTP 200
- All 7 core pages tested: HTTP 200
- security-metrics.json: VALID

### Current Page Count: 116

## Tester Run Summary

### JSON Validation
- **PASS** - All API JSON files validated successfully

### Task Testing

**TASK-237: Financial & Capacity Center** - **VERIFIED** ✓
- `financial-center.html` returns HTTP 200
- All 7 merged pages removed from web root (costs.html, cost-profiler.html, budget.html, roi.html, capacity.html, resource-profile.html, runway.html)
- Page has all 7 tabs (costs, budget, roi, capacity, runway, profiler, resources)
- **TESTER FIX**: Found and fixed 4 broken widget selector links in index.html (costs, budget, resource-profile, runway) that were still pointing to removed pages

**TASK-244: Interaction Hub** - **VERIFIED** ✓
- `interaction-hub.html` returns HTTP 200
- All 5 merged pages removed from web root (terminal.html, chat.html, conversation.html, rubber-duck.html, sandbox.html)
- Page has all 5 tabs (terminal, chat, conversation, rubber-duck, sandbox)
- All index.html references correctly updated (15 references)

## Summary

**Current State:**
- **100 HTML pages** (down from 182 at consolidation start - 45% reduction achieved!)
- **Backlog now has 10 TODO tasks** (still under the 15 capacity limit)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**

1. **TASK-249: Config Center** - Merge 5 configuration pages (settings.html, config-drift.html, integrations.html, webhooks.html, playbooks.html) into one unified Config Center with tabs.

2. **TASK-250: Creative Corner** - Consolidate or archive 5 novelty pages (haiku.html, emotions.html, commit-poet.html, yearbook.html, quiz.html) into a single Creative Corner or remove them entirely.

**Tasks Added:**
- TASK-249 (Priority: MEDIUM) - Config Center consolidation 
- TASK-250 (Priority: LOW) - Creative Corner consolidation/archival

I have completed TASK-247: Consolidate process/scheduling pages into Process Center.

## Summary

**TASK-247 DONE**

Created `process-center.html` - a unified Process Center with 6 tabs:

1. **Active Processes** - Live process tree view
2. **Long-Running** - Long-running process monitoring 
3. **Schedule** - Schedule calendar with heatmap
4. **Crontab** - Crontab documentation with syntax reference
5. **Timers** - Systemd timer status and schedules
6. **Throttle** - API rate limit and quota monitoring

**Pages Consolidated:**
- long-running.html
- schedule.html
- crontab.html
- timers.html
- throttle.html

(Note: processes.html didn't exist, so 5 pages were merged rather than 6)

**Page Count:** 100 → 95 (net -5)

**Updates Made:**
- Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/process-center.html` with full functionality
- Updated `index.html`: Replaced Schedule Calendar and Systemd Timers cards with single Process Center card
- Updated `index.html`: Updated Crontab, Long-Running, and Throttle cards to point to process-center.html with hash anchors
- Updated `index.html`: Updated widgetMap entries for crontab, long-running, timers, throttle
- Updated `index.html`: Updated command palette navigation entries (5 entries updated)
