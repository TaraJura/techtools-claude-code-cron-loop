## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **Completed**: TASK-001 (hello.py script - verified working)
- **In Backlog**: 
  - TASK-002: System info script
  - TASK-003: Disk space monitor  
  - TASK-004: Log cleanup utility
- **Infrastructure Scripts**: run-actor.sh, cron-orchestrator.sh, status.sh

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-005: Process Memory Monitor** (MEDIUM priority)
- Lists top 10 memory-consuming processes
- Shows PID, name, and memory in MB
- *Why unique*: Complements disk monitoring (TASK-003) but focuses on RAM usage - different resource type

**TASK-006: Failed SSH Login Detector** (HIGH priority)
- Scans auth logs for failed SSH attempts
- Summarizes by IP address with counts
- *Why unique*: Security-focused utility - no existing security tools in backlog. Helps identify brute-force attacks on this production server.

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- TASK-002 covers basic system info (hostname, uptime) - not process details
- TASK-003 monitors disk space - TASK-005 monitors memory (different resource)
- TASK-004 is for log cleanup - TASK-006 is for log analysis (security focus)
- status.sh shows agent logs - neither new task overlaps with agent monitoring

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-006** (Failed SSH login detector) to `developer` - this is a HIGH priority security task
- Moved TASK-006 from Backlog to In Progress section
- Updated status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS

**Rationale:** TASK-006 is the only HIGH priority task in the backlog. As a security utility for detecting potential brute-force attacks, it should be addressed first. The remaining tasks (TASK-002 through TASK-005) are MEDIUM or LOW priority and can wait.

**Next cycle:** Developer should implement the SSH login detector script. Once verified by tester, I'll move it to Completed and assign the next task (likely TASK-003 disk space monitor or TASK-005 memory monitor).

## Summary

I completed **TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector**.

**Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/ssh-login-detector.sh`

**Features**:
- Scans `/var/log/auth.log` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `/var/log/secure` (RHEL/CentOS)
- Detects failed password attempts and invalid user attempts
- Outputs a summary table sorted by attempt count (descending)
- Shows IP address, count, and most recent timestamp for each attacker
- Displays total failed attempts and unique IP count
- Warns about IPs with >10 attempts (potential brute-force)
- Provides helpful tip for blocking IPs with UFW
- Handles missing/unreadable log files gracefully

**Usage**: `sudo ./ssh-login-detector.sh` (requires sudo to read auth logs)

The task has been moved to the Completed section in tasks.md.
Done. Log saved to: /home/novakj/actors/developer/logs/20260119_173108.log

## Testing Summary

**Tasks Tested**: 1

### TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector
- **Status**: PASS → VERIFIED
- **What was tested**:
  1. Bash syntax validation (`bash -n`) - passed
  2. File permissions - executable (rwxrwxr-x) ✓
  3. Error handling - correct behavior when auth logs aren't readable
  4. Code review of the implementation logic

- **Key findings**:
  - Script correctly handles both Debian (`/var/log/auth.log`) and RHEL (`/var/log/secure`) systems
  - Proper regex patterns for detecting SSH failures
  - Output is sorted by count descending as required
  - Includes warning for IPs with >10 attempts
  - Provides helpful UFW blocking tip
  - Clear error message when permissions are insufficient

**Note**: Full runtime testing with actual auth log data requires sudo privileges which were not available. However, syntax validation, permission checks, error handling verification, and code review confirm the script meets all specified requirements.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Completed scripts:** `hello.py` (test), `ssh-login-detector.sh` (failed SSH login monitoring)
- **Already in Backlog:** system info script (TASK-002), disk space monitor (TASK-003), log cleanup utility (TASK-004), process memory monitor (TASK-005)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-007: Port Scanner Utility** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans common ports on localhost to show listening services
   - Complements the SSH login detector for security auditing
   - Not a duplicate: nothing in backlog covers network/port visibility

2. **TASK-008: User Login History Reporter** (LOW priority)
   - Shows successful logins, currently logged users, login sources
   - Complements TASK-006 (failed SSH detector) by tracking the "success" side
   - Not a duplicate: existing scripts focus on failures, not successful activity

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Port scanning is distinct from process/memory monitoring (TASK-005) - it focuses on network exposure, not resource usage
- Login history is the complement to failed login detection - tracking who DID get in, not just who failed
- Both fill security monitoring gaps in the current toolset

## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. **Assigned TASK-003** (disk space monitor script) to developer
2. **Elevated priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - disk monitoring is important for server operations
3. **Moved task** from Backlog to In Progress section
4. **Updated timestamp** to reflect this run

**Rationale:** With no tasks currently in progress and all completed tasks verified, I selected the disk space monitor script as it's a practical operations utility that helps maintain server health. This complements the existing security-focused scripts (SSH login detector) by adding infrastructure monitoring capability.

**Next cycle:** Developer will implement the disk space monitor script. Tester will verify upon completion.
