Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 158 HTML pages in the web app covering extensive monitoring, analytics, security, agents, and many creative/unique visualization pages
- 27 existing tasks in the backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 200+ archived tasks covering everything from basic monitoring to creative concepts like haiku journals, ghost hunters, diplomatic relations, and memory palaces

**New Ideas Added:**

### TASK-207: System "Stock Exchange" and Metric Trading Floor Page
Reimagines system metrics as stocks on a trading floor with:
- Metrics as stocks with real-time price movements
- Market index for overall system health
- Ticker tape displays and candlestick charts
- Bull/bear indicators and analyst ratings
- Watchlists, portfolios, and market news

**Why it's not a duplicate:** Uses financial/market metaphors which aren't covered by existing analytics, trends, or budget pages. Gamifies metrics in a unique way that leverages users' intuition about markets.

### TASK-208: System "Construction Site" and Feature Building Progress Page
Visualizes development as a construction site with:
- Completed features as buildings in a skyline
- In-progress tasks as scaffolded structures with cranes
- Agents as hard-hat workers
- Phases: foundation → framing → finishing → ribbon cutting
- Time-lapse city growth view

**Why it's not a duplicate:** Uses construction/building metaphors which aren't covered by existing architecture, genealogy, task-graph, or timeline pages. Makes abstract feature development visually tangible in a way SimCity-style that existing pages don't.
