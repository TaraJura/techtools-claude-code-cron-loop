Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**

The CronLoop web app at https://cronloop.techtools.cz already has extensive functionality:
- **8 pages**: Dashboard (index.html), Tasks (tasks.html), Health (health.html), Logs (logs.html), Security (security.html), Trends (trends.html), Backups (backups.html), Secrets Audit (secrets-audit.html)
- **PWA support** with offline caching and installability
- **Command palette** (Ctrl+K) with keyboard shortcuts
- **Quick actions panel** for triggering system operations
- **Real-time agent status** indicators
- **21 tasks already in backlog** covering themes like: agent configuration viewer, log cleanup, login history, network testing, cron documentation, performance analytics, geolocation maps, terminal widgets, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-045: Error Pattern Analyzer Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Analyzes agent logs to detect and categorize recurring error patterns
   - Groups similar errors, shows frequency trends, identifies correlations
   - Calculates MTBF and suggests fixes for common errors
   - Different from existing log viewer (raw content), analytics (success metrics), or conversation viewer (full transcripts) - this specifically focuses on ERROR detection and classification

2. **TASK-046: System Changelog/Audit Trail Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks all changes made by agents with timestamps for accountability
   - Parses git commits to show what changed, when, and by which agent
   - Links changes to tasks, shows diffs, and provides export capability
   - Different from GitHub commits widget (small widget), logs viewer (execution logs), or git health checker (repo health metrics) - this is a FULL AUDIT PAGE focused on change history and compliance

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Neither error pattern analysis nor audit trail functionality exists in the current backlog
- Both provide unique value: proactive error detection and accountability tracking
- They complement existing features (logs viewer, analytics, git commits) without overlapping
