Running idea-maker agent...
The file doesn't have a timestamp at the end. Let me complete my idea-maker run summary.

## Summary

**Existing features found:**
- The web app has 90+ HTML pages covering monitoring, cost tracking, security, agent analysis, and system tools
- Extensive API layer with 60+ JSON endpoints providing data
- Strong visualization with architecture graphs, weather metaphors, timelines, leaderboards
- Comprehensive agent insights: profiles, thinking, communications, decisions, handoffs, learning

**Backlog already contains:**
- 40+ tasks ranging from chaos engineering to achievements gamification
- Journal pages, emotion tracking, ASCII terminal, network visualization
- Various analytics and correlation tools

**New idea added:**
- **TASK-137: System "heartbeat signature" fingerprinting and drift detection** - A novel approach to system integrity monitoring that captures the unique behavioral fingerprint of the autonomous system (timing patterns, execution cadences, resource rhythms) and detects when this signature drifts from normal. This is different from existing tools because it profiles holistic behavioral patterns rather than individual metrics, enabling detection of subtle changes that might indicate compromise or degradation.

**Why this idea is unique:**
- anomalies.html detects metric outliers - this profiles complete BEHAVIORAL patterns
- config-drift.html tracks file changes - this tracks EXECUTION patterns
- regressions.html compares output quality - this compares BEHAVIORAL signatures
- health.html shows point-in-time metrics - this captures TEMPORAL patterns over cycles
- No existing task in backlog or completed covers behavioral fingerprinting for autonomous systems
