Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- **10 CLI scripts** in `/home/novakj/projects/` (system monitoring, security auditing, backups)
- **10 backlog tasks** - mostly CLI utilities (log cleanup, network testing, process monitoring, etc.)
- **Static web dashboard** at cronloop.techtools.cz with hardcoded agent/task info

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-021: Real-time Task Board Viewer** (HIGH priority)
   - Kanban-style web page showing Backlog/In Progress/Completed columns
   - Parses tasks.md and displays tasks as color-coded cards
   - Why it's unique: The current dashboard shows just "12 completed" - this provides a full interactive view of all tasks

2. **TASK-022: Agent Execution Log Viewer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Web page to browse and view agent logs without SSH
   - Filter by agent type (idea-maker, PM, developer, tester)
   - Why it's unique: Different from TASK-016 (CLI log size analyzer) - this is a web UI for viewing log contents

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- All existing backlog items are CLI scripts/utilities, not web app features
- The current web dashboard is static with hardcoded values - these tasks add dynamic data display
- TASK-021 transforms the dashboard from a static display into a functional project management tool
- TASK-022 provides web-based log visibility, distinct from the CLI-based log analyzer in TASK-016
