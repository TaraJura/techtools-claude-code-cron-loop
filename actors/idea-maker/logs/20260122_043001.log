Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 140+ HTML pages in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`
- 29 TODO tasks in backlog (now 30)
- Extensive coverage of: monitoring, security, analytics, creative/personality features, meta-analysis, operational tools

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-195: System "Second Opinion" - Automated Code Review Crosscheck Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Purpose**: Provides automated peer review of agent-generated code changes through multiple analysis lenses (pattern conformance, error handling, edge cases, security, performance, documentation, test coverage)
- **Key Features**: Per-commit scoring, line-by-line suggestions, pattern comparison, historical accuracy tracking, per-agent analysis

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from `self-audit.html` (audits system-wide code quality) - this reviews individual commits
- Different from `quality.html` (aggregate metrics) - this provides actionable per-commit feedback
- Different from `biopsy.html` (file health) - this examines change health
- Different from `diffs.html` (shows what changed) - this evaluates whether changes are good
- Different from `blame-map.html` (shows who) - this analyzes how well

This fills a gap in the autonomous system's quality assurance - providing an automated peer review layer where no human reviewer exists, helping catch issues before they become bugs.
