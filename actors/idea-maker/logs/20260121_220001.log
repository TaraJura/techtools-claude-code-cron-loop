Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 130+ web app pages covering dashboards, monitoring, security, agents, analytics, costs
- Recent completions: narrator.html (audio), quiz.html (interactive quiz), mood ring widget
- Backlog has 24 TODO tasks (below 30 threshold)

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-172: Resource Runway Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Aviation-themed capacity planning dashboard
   - Calculates "days until resource exhaustion" for disk, API budget, tokens, memory
   - Visual runway bars, what-if calculators, automatic recommendations
   - Different from existing pages: capacity.html shows current state, this projects timelines
   - Why unique: Transforms abstract metrics into actionable "you have X days" answers

2. **TASK-173: Doc Rot Detector Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Documentation freshness analyzer comparing docs against code changes
   - Detects outdated sections, broken references, stale comments
   - Generates fix suggestions and tracks documentation health over time
   - Different from existing pages: docs.html browses docs, this validates accuracy
   - Why unique: Critical for an autonomous self-documenting system to stay truthful

Both ideas focus on **actionable insights** rather than artistic/conceptual pages, filling gaps in the operational tooling. They support the system's self-improvement goal by catching problems proactively.
