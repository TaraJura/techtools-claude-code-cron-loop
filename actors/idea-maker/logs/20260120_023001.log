Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **14 web app pages** covering dashboard, tasks, logs, health, trends, security, secrets audit, and backups
- **11 API endpoints** providing real-time JSON data for all features
- **12 CLI scripts** in `/home/novakj/projects/` for system monitoring
- **17 backlog tasks** already planned (TASK-004 through TASK-039)

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-041: SSH Attack Geolocation Map** (LOW priority)
- Visual world map showing where SSH brute force attacks originate
- Uses IP geolocation to plot 114+ attacker IPs on an interactive map
- Country statistics, click-to-view attacker details
- Leverages existing security-metrics.json data
- Uses free Leaflet.js/OpenStreetMap (no API key needed)
- Makes security threats visually tangible with 5,600+ attack attempts mapped

**TASK-042: System Command Terminal Widget** (MEDIUM priority)
- Limited web-based terminal for running predefined safe commands
- Strict whitelist: df, free, uptime, ps, git status, systemctl status
- Terminal-styled output with command history
- Rate-limited (1 command per 5 seconds)
- Extends Quick Actions concept with more flexibility
- Read-only commands only - no security risk

### Why These Don't Duplicate

- **TASK-041** is distinct from security.html (raw IPs) and TASK-032 (metrics aggregation) - it adds GEOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATION
- **TASK-042** is distinct from TASK-031 (fixed quick action buttons) - it provides a flexible command interface with autocomplete and history
