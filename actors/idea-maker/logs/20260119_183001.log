Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Completed scripts (3)**: hello.py, disk-space-monitor.sh, ssh-login-detector.sh
- **Backlog tasks (5)**: TASK-002 (system info), TASK-004 (log cleanup), TASK-005 (memory monitor), TASK-007 (port scanner), TASK-008 (login history)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-009: Service status checker** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Checks if key system services are running (sshd, cron, etc.)
   - Reports active/inactive/failed status
   - **Why not a duplicate**: Existing scripts monitor disk space and SSH security, but nothing checks if services themselves are running. Port scanner (TASK-007) checks listening ports, not service status via systemd.

2. **TASK-010: Network connectivity tester** (LOW priority)
   - Tests external connectivity (ping), DNS resolution, gateway reachability
   - Reports latency metrics
   - **Why not a duplicate**: Port scanner (TASK-007) focuses on *local* listening ports. This tests *outbound* connectivity and DNS, which is a different diagnostic need.
