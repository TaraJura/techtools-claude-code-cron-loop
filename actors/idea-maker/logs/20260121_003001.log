Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- **60+ web pages** already exist in /var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/ covering agents, alerts, anomalies, architecture, backups, costs, debug, health, logs, metrics, security, settings, tasks, timeline, and many more
- **30+ backlog tasks** already pending including chaos engineering, performance benchmarks, resource profiler, heartbeat monitor, prompt evolution, file heatmap, workload balancer, and others

**New idea added:**

### TASK-117: Add accessibility compliance and WCAG audit page to CronLoop web app
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Create a page that audits all CronLoop web pages for accessibility compliance, checking WCAG 2.1 guidelines and displaying issues with remediation suggestions
- **Why unique**: No existing page audits for accessibility. While quality.html tracks code quality, there's no WCAG compliance checking. This is important for making the dashboard usable by people with disabilities and meeting legal accessibility requirements.

**Key features proposed:**
- Automated checks: color contrast, alt text, ARIA labels, heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation
- Per-page accessibility scores (0-100)
- Issue severity levels with specific remediation suggestions
- Trend tracking to show improvement over time
