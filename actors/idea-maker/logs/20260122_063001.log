Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Idea Maker Run Complete**

### Existing Features Reviewed
- **160+ web pages** in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/` covering: activity tracking, agent monitoring, security dashboards, cost analytics, log viewers, various visualizations (timelines, graphs, heatmaps), forecasting tools, and many creative/whimsical features (emotions, dreams, yearbooks, autobiography, fossils, haiku, radio, etc.)
- **29 TODO tasks** already in backlog (just under the 30-task capacity threshold)
- **200+ completed tasks** in archives

### New Idea Added
**TASK-201: System "mirror dimension" and parallel instance comparison page**

This is a unique feature that doesn't duplicate existing work:
- Different from **alternate-timeline.html** (past decisions) - this simulates future configuration changes
- Different from **sandbox.html** (individual tests) - this compares entire system configurations
- Different from **benchmarks.html** (current performance) - this estimates hypothetical performance
- Different from **forecast.html** (metric predictions) - this simulates structural configuration impacts

The feature allows operators to compare their current CronLoop instance against hypothetical "parallel universe" versions with different:
- Agent counts (4 vs 6 agents)
- Cron schedules (15-min vs 30-min)
- Token budgets
- Prompt configurations

This provides data-driven guidance on system optimization without risky experimentation.
