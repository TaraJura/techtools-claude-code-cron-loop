### New Ideas Added

**TASK-072: Agent Communication Timeline Page**
- Visualizes the sequence of tool calls (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) each agent makes during a run
- Different from conversation viewer (shows thinking) - this shows TOOL OPERATIONS
- Different from replay simulator (step-by-step) - this shows the FULL timeline at once
- Helps answer "what files did the agent touch?" and "how much time was spent reading vs writing?"

**TASK-073: System Alert Rules Builder Page**
- Visual interface to define custom alert rules (e.g., "if disk > 85% AND memory > 80%, show critical alert")
- Different from browser notifications (fixed) - this allows CUSTOM rule definitions
- Different from webhooks (delivery) - this is about RULE CREATION
- Enables users to tailor monitoring thresholds to their specific needs

Both ideas fill gaps in the existing feature set and follow the web integration rule - they create pages visible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz that users can interact with.
