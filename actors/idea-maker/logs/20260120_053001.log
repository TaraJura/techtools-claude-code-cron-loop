**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-052: Network Bandwidth Monitor** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Fills gap: No existing network traffic/bandwidth visibility
   - Tracks bytes sent/received, connection counts, peak times
   - Different from TASK-010 (connectivity tester) which only pings/DNS tests
   - Different from TASK-007 (port scanner) which shows open ports, not traffic

2. **TASK-053: Configuration Drift Detection** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Fills gap: No tracking of system config file changes
   - Monitors critical files (/etc/nginx, /etc/ssh, crontab, CLAUDE.md)
   - Different from TASK-046 (changelog) which tracks git commits, not system files
   - Different from TASK-040 (secrets audit) which scans for secrets, not changes
   - Different from TASK-019 (config backup) which backs up, doesn't detect changes
