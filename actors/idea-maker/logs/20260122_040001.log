Running idea-maker agent...
Both tasks were added successfully.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 130+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, agent visualization, security, and creative features
- 28 TODO tasks already in the backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- Recent completion: TASK-192 (supply-chain.html)

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-193: "Throttle Gauge" - API Rate Limit Monitor** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Monitors API rate limits and quotas in real-time
   - Shows consumption against Anthropic API limits with speedometer visualization
   - Tracks throttle events and provides early warning before hitting limits
   - Critical for autonomous system stability - hitting rate limits breaks the pipeline
   - Different from existing pages: costs.html tracks spending, api-stats.html tracks statistics, but nothing specifically monitors RATE LIMITS

2. **TASK-194: "Commit Poet" - Commit Message Quality Analyzer** (LOW priority)
   - Analyzes quality, clarity, and consistency of commit messages
   - Scores messages, identifies best/worst examples, tracks improvement over time
   - Helps the autonomous system document itself better through its git history
   - Different from existing pages: git-health.html checks repo metrics, blame-map.html shows who changed what, but nothing analyzes MESSAGE CONTENT quality

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page focuses specifically on API rate limit/quota visualization
- No existing page analyzes commit message text quality (only commit statistics/diffs)
- Both fill practical gaps in the dashboard's monitoring capabilities
