Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current State:**
- **Page count**: 172 HTML pages (down from 182 after TASK-228 merged 11 health pages into health-center.html)
- **Backlog**: Now 14 TODO tasks (under the 15 threshold)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
The consolidation report identifies 17 merge groups that can reduce 172 pages to ~68 pages (60% reduction). Key Phase 2 priorities were missing from the backlog.

**Tasks Added:**

1. **TASK-238: Log Analysis Hub** (HIGH priority)
   - Merges: logs.html, log-analysis.html, error-patterns.html, debug.html, postmortem.html, root-cause.html, correlation.html
   - Reduction: 7 pages → 1
   - Rationale: Critical for incident response - having debugging tools scattered makes troubleshooting slower

2. **TASK-239: Analytics Hub** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Merges: analytics.html, trends.html, usage.html, api-stats.html, benchmarks.html, heatmap.html, api-perf.html, freshness.html
   - Reduction: 8 pages → 1
   - Rationale: Performance metrics spread across 8 pages makes holistic analysis difficult

Both are Phase 2 items from the consolidation report that should follow after the current Phase 1 tasks (Agent Hub, Security Center, Timeline, Financial) are complete.
