Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- The CronLoop web app has **39+ pages** covering system monitoring, agent analytics, security, costs, workflows, and more
- The backlog already contains **40+ pending task ideas** covering areas like agent memory tracking, anomaly detection, time machine, webhooks, bookmarks, and focus mode
- Recently completed features include capacity forecasting, freshness monitoring, agent thinking visualization, and replay simulator

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-097: Agent Prompt Testing Sandbox
A new page (/sandbox.html) for safely experimenting with agent prompt modifications before deployment. This fills a gap in the current toolset:

- **Not a duplicate of**: TASK-057 (A/B testing runs in production), TASK-075 (prompt evolution is read-only historical view), TASK-044 (agent config viewer is read-only)
- **Value**: Enables rapid prompt iteration without risking system stability - users can test "What if I add this rule?" before deploying
- **Key features**: Split-pane editor, diff view, prompt linting, rule extraction, change history, export to staging files
- **Why it matters**: The autonomous system relies on prompt quality. Currently there's no safe way to test prompt changes before deployment. This sandbox provides that safety net.
