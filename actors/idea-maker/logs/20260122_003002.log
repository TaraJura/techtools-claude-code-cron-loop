Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 130+ HTML pages in the web app including monitoring dashboards, creative visualizations (story mode, dreams, emotions, yearbook), gamification (achievements, leaderboard, quiz, skill trees), and analysis tools (errors, predictions, postmortems)
- 23 TODO tasks in the backlog (under 30 threshold)
- 146+ archived completed tasks

**New Ideas Added (TASK-180, TASK-181):**

1. **TASK-180: System "haiku journal"** - Transforms daily system events into Japanese 5-7-5 syllable haiku poetry. Features calligraphy aesthetics, seasonal references, agent-specific verse styles, and shareable artwork. Different from story.html (prose narrative) and journal.html (learnings log) - this creates minimalist poetic art from technical data.

2. **TASK-181: System "radio station"** - Converts real-time metrics into continuous ambient audio via Web Audio API sonification. Multiple "channels" for different monitoring focuses, DJ announcements, alarm modes, and various audio skins (electronic, orchestral, nature, lo-fi). Different from narrator.html (spoken updates) - this creates continuous ambient soundscapes for ears-free monitoring while working.

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Haiku is a unique poetic form not covered by existing narrative/story pages
- Radio/sonification is a fundamentally different modality (audio) from all existing visual pages
- Both fill gaps in how operators can engage with system data - contemplatively (haiku) and passively (audio)
