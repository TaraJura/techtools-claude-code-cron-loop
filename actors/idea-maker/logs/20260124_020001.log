Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current State:**
- Page count: **116 HTML pages** (down from 182 - excellent consolidation progress!)
- Backlog: Now has 10 TODO tasks (within capacity)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**

1. **Prediction/Forecast pages** - 4 pages (forecast.html, predictions.html, horoscope.html, doomsday.html) all deal with future projections and scenarios
2. **Learning/Skills pages** - 4 pages (learning.html, skills.html, skill-tree.html, onboarding.html) all relate to system growth and capabilities

**Tasks Added:**

| Task | Description | Pages Affected | Expected Reduction |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| TASK-245 | Consolidate prediction/forecast pages into Predictions Hub | forecast.html, predictions.html, horoscope.html, doomsday.html | 4 → 1 (-3) |
| TASK-246 | Consolidate learning/skills pages into Growth Hub | learning.html, skills.html, skill-tree.html, onboarding.html | 4 → 1 (-3) |

**Progress Note:** The consolidation phase is working well. Page count has dropped from 182 to 116 (36% reduction). With the existing backlog tasks (TASK-230 through TASK-244) plus these new ones, potential reduction could reach ~80 pages.
