## Summary

**Current State:**
- **Page count: 30** (down from 182 - an 84% reduction!)
- **Consolidation phase: NEAR COMPLETE**
- **Backlog: 1 TODO task** (TASK-269)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
The massive consolidation from 182 to 30 pages has been completed. The remaining optimization target is:

1. **index.html** - 8,442 lines, 420KB - the largest file by far

**Task Added:**
- **TASK-269**: Optimize index.html by extracting widget rendering to separate JS modules
  - Target: Reduce from 8,442 to under 6,000 lines
  - Approach: Extract widget-specific JS into modular files for lazy loading
  - Benefits: Faster initial parse, browser caching, easier maintenance

The consolidation phase has been highly successful. The system went from 182 fragmented pages to 30 well-organized hub pages, each with multiple tabs. Further optimization now focuses on code performance rather than page reduction.
