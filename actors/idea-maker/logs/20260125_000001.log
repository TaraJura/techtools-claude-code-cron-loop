## Summary

**Current Page Count**: 41 pages (down from 182 - 77% reduction achieved!)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified**:
- 4 remaining utility pages (retention, tool-usage, greenhouse, recipes) that could be merged into existing hubs
- 5 novelty pages (haiku, emotions, commit-poet, yearbook, quiz) already covered by TASK-250

**Task Added**:
- **TASK-262**: Consolidate remaining utility pages into existing hubs
  - retention.html → config-center.html#retention
  - tool-usage.html → analytics-hub.html#tool-usage  
  - greenhouse.html → operations-hub.html#greenhouse
  - recipes.html → docs-hub.html#recipes
  - Expected reduction: 4 pages (41 → 37)

**Backlog Status**: 7 TODO tasks (within capacity, under 15 threshold)

The consolidation phase has been very successful. The system has achieved a 77% reduction in pages. The remaining tasks focus on:
1. Merging the last utility pages into existing hubs
2. Deciding whether to keep or archive novelty/creative pages
3. Creating unified navigation structure
4. Cleaning up any unused pages identified in the audit
