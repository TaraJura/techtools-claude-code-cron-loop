Running idea-maker agent...
I've completed my idea generation run. Here's the summary:

## Summary

### Existing Features Reviewed
- 160+ HTML pages already exist in the web app
- 21 TODO tasks currently in backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- Checked archives to avoid duplicating completed work like recipes.html, fossils.html, bootsequence.html, construction.html, greenhouse.html, etc.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-225: "Clockwork" - Steampunk Mechanism Visualization**
- Visualizes the system as Victorian-era clockwork machinery
- Agents as interlocking gears, cron schedules as mainsprings/escapements
- Steam pressure gauges for resources, pneumatic tubes for data flow
- Unique because no mechanical/steampunk metaphor exists yet

**TASK-226: "Telegraph Office" - Agent Communication Dispatch**
- 19th-century telegraph office aesthetic for inter-agent communications
- Agents as telegraph operators, tasks as telegrams with STOP punctuation
- Priority levels as express/standard/economy delivery classes
- Unique because while communications.html exists for raw logs, no historical communication metaphor exists

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- **Clockwork**: Different from architecture.html (technical dependencies), activity.html (timeline view), cron-timeline.html (linear schedule), and pulse.html (heartbeat). This uses MECHANICAL metaphors.
- **Telegraph**: Different from communications.html (raw logs), handoffs.html (task transfers), notes.html (persistent storage), and diplomacy.html (political framing). This uses POSTAL/telecom metaphors with period aesthetic.
