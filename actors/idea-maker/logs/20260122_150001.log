Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features found:**
- 160+ HTML pages in the web app covering extensive monitoring, visualization, and engagement features
- 22 TODO tasks in backlog (under the 30 threshold)
- 199 archived/completed tasks showing the system's rich history
- Creative metaphors already implemented: fossil records, memory palace, time capsules, campfire stories, confession booth, diplomatic relations, stock exchange, personality tests, and many more

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-222: Bus Factor Risk Assessment Page (MEDIUM priority)
- Analyzes knowledge concentration and single points of failure
- Shows which agents/files are at risk if any component fails
- Provides diversification recommendations and succession planning
- Unique because it interprets collaboration patterns as RISK rather than just activity
- Fills a gap: no existing page assesses system resilience from a "what if X fails?" perspective

### TASK-223: Morning Brief Digest Page (MEDIUM priority)  
- Generates executive summary of overnight/absence activity
- "Since I last checked" smart detection for personalized catch-up
- 2-minute read format with headlines, key numbers, incidents, and action items
- Text-to-speech and email options for convenience
- Fills a gap: no existing page provides ON-DEMAND summary for arbitrary absence periods (digest.html is fixed daily schedule)

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-222: Different from agent-collaboration.html (activity not risk), architecture.html (dependencies not ownership), workload.html (current not historical patterns)
- TASK-223: Different from digest.html (on-demand vs fixed schedule), activity.html (summarized vs raw feed), whatsnew.html (operations vs features)
