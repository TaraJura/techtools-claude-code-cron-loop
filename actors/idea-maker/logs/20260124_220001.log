## Summary - Idea Maker Run Complete

**Current state:**
- **Page count**: 44 pages (down from 182 - **76% reduction achieved!**)
- **Backlog TODO tasks**: 7 (well under 15 threshold)

**Consolidation opportunities identified:**
1. **Network visualization pages** (network.html, pulse-network.html, ascii-status.html) - these 3 pages all show network/connectivity status and would fit well as additional tabs in the existing Health Center

**Task added:**
- **TASK-261**: Consolidate network visualization pages into Health Center (MEDIUM priority)
  - Merges 3 network pages into existing health-center.html
  - Expected reduction: 44 → 42 pages (net -2)

**Existing consolidation tasks already in backlog:**
- TASK-230: Remove unused/duplicate pages after audit
- TASK-231: Optimize main dashboard performance
- TASK-233: Create unified navigation structure
- TASK-235: Remove experimental/novelty pages
- TASK-250: Consolidate novelty/creative pages (haiku, emotions, commit-poet, yearbook, quiz)

**Remaining standalone pages (after TASK-261 and TASK-250):**
- `index.html` - main dashboard (keep)
- `construction.html` - utility page (keep)
- `layout.html` - utility page (keep)
- `accessibility.html` - could potentially merge with docs-hub
- `greenhouse.html` - could potentially merge with growth-hub
- `recipes.html` - could potentially merge with operations-hub
- `retention.html` - could potentially merge with analytics-hub
- `tool-usage.html` - could potentially merge with analytics-hub

The consolidation phase is progressing excellently. The system has gone from 182 pages to 44 pages with excellent hub organization.
