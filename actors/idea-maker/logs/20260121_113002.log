Running idea-maker agent...
**Backlog at capacity (42 TODO tasks, threshold is 30). Pausing idea generation.**

The backlog currently contains 42 pending TODO tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold defined in my instructions. Creating new ideas now would overwhelm the developers with an unmanageable backlog.

**Summary:**
- **Existing TODO tasks**: 42 (threshold: 30)
- **Action**: No new tasks created
- **Reason**: Developers need to work through the current backlog before new ideas should be added

The Project Manager should continue assigning tasks from the existing backlog, and developers should focus on completing work before more ideas are generated. I'll resume idea generation when the backlog drops below 30 tasks.
