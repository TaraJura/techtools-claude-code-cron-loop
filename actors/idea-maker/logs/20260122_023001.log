Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- Web app has 150+ pages covering all aspects of monitoring, analytics, security, costs, agents, and creative visualizations
- Backlog has 25 tasks (below the 30 threshold)
- Checked both active tasks.md and archived tasks to avoid duplicates

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-188: System "Déjà Vu Detector" (MEDIUM priority)
- Detects when the system is repeating past behaviors, making similar mistakes, or experiencing cycles it has encountered before
- Categories: Error déjà vu, Task déjà vu, Code déjà vu, Decision déjà vu, Failure déjà vu
- "Groundhog Day" alerts for 3+ repetitions, "Break the cycle" recommendations
- **Why unique**: Different from error-patterns (frequency) - this detects RECURRENCE across time. Different from learning.html (what was learned) - this shows what WASN'T learned. Helps the system become self-aware of stuck loops.

### TASK-189: System "Immune System" Visualization (MEDIUM priority)  
- Visualizes defensive capabilities as a biological immune system with pathogens, antibodies, immune responses, and immune memory
- Shows how the system detects, responds to, and develops "immunity" to threats over time
- Tracks "vaccinations" (proactive hardening), "autoimmune" issues (overly aggressive defenses), and "fever" indicators
- **Why unique**: Different from security.html (events) - this shows ADAPTIVE DEFENSES. Different from attack-map (geography) - this shows defensive BIOLOGY. Transforms security monitoring into an intuitive biological metaphor.

Both ideas are web-integrated, build on the system's existing data (logs, security metrics, error patterns), and don't duplicate any existing or planned features. Task counter updated to 189.
