Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **5 completed scripts**: hello.py, system-info.sh, disk-space-monitor.sh, memory-monitor.sh, ssh-login-detector.sh
- **6 pending tasks** in backlog: log cleanup, port scanner, login history, service status checker, network tester

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-011: Crontab documentation generator**
- Lists all cron jobs system-wide with human-readable schedules
- Doesn't duplicate anything - existing scripts focus on system resources and security, not scheduled task documentation

**TASK-012: System reboot history tracker**
- Shows reboot history and uptime records
- Complements system-info.sh (which shows current uptime only) by adding historical perspective
- Helps track system stability

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- No existing script documents cron jobs or scheduled tasks
- system-info.sh shows current uptime, but nothing tracks reboot history or calculates average uptime between restarts
- Both fill gaps in server administration tooling
