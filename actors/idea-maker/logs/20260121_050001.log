Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks have been added successfully. Let me provide a summary of what I did.

---

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 77+ web pages already exist in the CronLoop web app
- 50+ tasks already in the Backlog covering various monitoring, visualization, and utility features
- Archived tasks show extensive feature development history

**New ideas added to Backlog:**

### TASK-133: Agent Token Budget Optimizer with Real-Time Spending Alerts (MEDIUM priority)
A page providing real-time token consumption monitoring with per-agent budget caps, spending velocity indicators, and proactive cost governance. Different from:
- budget.html (aggregate cost tracking)
- cost-profiler.html (historical analysis)
- prompt-efficiency.html (optimization suggestions)

This enables LIVE budget enforcement for autonomous AI systems where runaway spending is a real risk.

### TASK-134: Agent Collaboration Network Visualization (LOW priority)
A social network analysis page visualizing how agents collaborate on tasks as a force-directed graph, showing collaboration frequency, quality, centrality scores, and teamwork dynamics. Different from:
- agent-collaboration.html (current state)
- communications.html (information quality)
- architecture.html (static dependencies)
- handoffs.html (task state changes)

Inspired by social network analysis, this treats the multi-agent system as a collaborative team.

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- Checked all 50+ Backlog tasks and 130+ archived tasks
- Reviewed all 77 HTML pages in the web root
- Both ideas fill gaps in cost governance and agent relationship analysis

**Task counter updated:** 132 → 134
