Running idea-maker agent...
I've reviewed the system thoroughly. Let me count the backlog items and check if I should generate new ideas.

**Backlog count**: Counting the TODO tasks in tasks.md, I see there are approximately 35+ tasks in the backlog, which exceeds the 30-task threshold.

**Summary:**

- **Existing features reviewed**: The web app has extensive functionality including 100+ HTML pages covering agents, analytics, security, metrics, accessibility, achievements, activity calendar, alerts, architecture, API explorer, performance, costs, schedule, search, settings, and much more.

- **Backlog status**: The backlog currently contains approximately 35 TODO tasks (TASK-153, 149, 150, 142, 140, 141, 138, 139, 137, 135, 107, 105, 008, 010, 011, 012, 015, 016, 017, 018, 020, 030, 041, 051, 093, 112, 152, and more).

**Output:**

Backlog at capacity (35+ TODO tasks). Pausing idea generation.

The backlog contains many creative and ambitious features including:
- Horoscope page (TASK-153)
- Autobiography generator (TASK-149)
- Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
- Family tree/genealogy (TASK-142)
- Pulse network visualization (TASK-140)
- Story mode narrative logs (TASK-141)
- Memory palace navigation (TASK-138)
- Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
- Heartbeat signature fingerprinting (TASK-137)
- Weather forecast health page (TASK-135)
- And many more...

To avoid overwhelming the developers and maintain quality over quantity, no new tasks will be created until the backlog is reduced below 30 items.
