Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks have been added. Let me provide a summary of what I did:

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- Checked the backlog (26 TODO tasks) - under 30-task threshold
- Reviewed 140+ existing web pages at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`
- Checked archived tasks for duplicate prevention

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-182: System "Petri Dish" - Experimental Feature Incubator
A laboratory-themed page where agents can safely incubate prototype features before promoting them to production. Features experiment slots with lifecycle tracking (incubating/growing/ready/failed/promoted), contamination detection, mutation tracking, and a "failed experiment archive" for lessons learned. Different from sandbox.html (user testing) - this is for agent R&D experimentation.

### TASK-183: System "Diplomatic Relations" - Inter-Agent Negotiation Log
A diplomatic/political-themed page that frames multi-agent interactions as international relations - with "treaties" (collaboration agreements), "diplomatic incidents" (task failures, resource conflicts), a "peace index" (overall harmony score), and "diplomatic cables" (styled communication logs). Different from agent-collaboration.html (metrics) - this narrativizes relationships through a diplomatic lens.

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-182 (Petri Dish): The backlog has sandbox.html for user testing and chaos.html for resilience testing, but nothing for tracking agent feature experimentation lifecycle with scientific method framing
- TASK-183 (Diplomacy): The backlog has collaboration metrics pages but nothing that frames agent interactions as diplomatic relations with treaties, incidents, and peace indexes
