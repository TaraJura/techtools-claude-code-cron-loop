Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**21 Web Pages Already Built:**
- Dashboard (index.html), Agents (agents.html), Architecture (architecture.html)
- API Stats, Backups, Changelog, Costs, Dependencies, Digest
- Error Patterns, Forecast, Health, Logs, Playbooks
- Secrets Audit, Security, Tasks, Terminal, Trends, Uptime, Workflow

**42 Tasks Already in Backlog** covering:
- Time machine, snapshots, timelines, heatmaps
- Agent handoffs, releases, learning tracker, workload balancer
- Decision explainer, activity page, webhooks, prompt versioning
- Network bandwidth, config drift, process tree
- Various CLI utilities and additional web features

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-078: Incident Postmortem Generator** (MEDIUM priority)
- Auto-generates incident reports when system issues occur
- Aggregates logs, metrics, and timeline data into structured documents
- Includes template with: Summary, Timeline, Impact, Root Cause, Resolution, Action Items
- Links to related pages, exports as Markdown/PDF
- Distinct from error-patterns (which shows patterns) and playbooks (which provides remediation) - this documents WHAT HAPPENED

**TASK-079: Global Search** (HIGH priority)
- Unified search across all dashboard data: tasks, commits, errors, logs, agents
- Instant search with debounced input, results grouped by source
- Keyword highlighting, direct navigation to source pages
- Filter by source type and date range, search operators
- Essential for a 20+ page dashboard - users need to find specific items without manually checking each page

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- **Postmortem Generator**: No existing task creates structured incident reports. Error analyzer (TASK-045) shows patterns, decision explainer (TASK-054) explains agent choices, playbooks help remediate - but nothing documents incidents after they occur.

- **Global Search**: The Ctrl+K palette navigates to PAGES, logs.html search only searches logs, and conversation viewer shows ONE agent. No task provides cross-source search across all 20+ pages of data.
