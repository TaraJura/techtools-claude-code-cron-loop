Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- ~160 HTML pages already built in the web app
- Current backlog has 23 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Recent completions: genealogy.html (family tree), alternate-timeline.html (what-if scenarios)
- Extensive features covering: metrics, agents, security, tasks, analytics, AI introspection, visualization

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-214: System "Soundtrack"** - A real-time musical score composer that transforms the system's day into an emotional narrative with dynamic music. Different from the proposed radio.html (TASK-181) which does continuous ambient sonification - this creates story-driven musical compositions with leitmotifs, dramatic swells, and narrative arcs.

2. **TASK-215: "Confession Booth"** - A safe space for the AI to express doubts, uncertainties, and epistemic limitations before they become actual failures. Different from confessions.html (TASK-162) which admits past mistakes - this surfaces pre-emptive uncertainty. Different from whispers.html (TASK-170) which captures informal observations - this specifically addresses AI confidence levels and knowledge boundaries.

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-214 differs from radio.html (TASK-181) in that it creates narrative-structured compositions with emotional arcs rather than continuous metric sonification
- TASK-215 differs from confessions.html in focusing on uncertainty/doubt rather than admitted failures, and from whispers.html in focusing on epistemic humility rather than general observations
