Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current State:**
- **133 HTML pages** in production (reduced from 182 at consolidation start - 27% reduction so far)
- **10 TODO tasks** now in backlog (8 existing + 2 new)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**

1. **TASK-243: Story Hub** - Merge 11 narrative/memory pages:
   - story.html, autobiography.html, journal.html, memory.html, confessions.html, dreams.html, thinking.html, whispers.html, decisions.html, eureka.html, notes.html
   - These all represent the AI's self-reflection and narrative identity
   - Potential reduction: 11 → 1 (net -10 pages)

2. **TASK-244: Interaction Hub** - Merge 5 interactive/sandbox pages:
   - terminal.html, chat.html, conversation.html, rubber-duck.html, sandbox.html
   - All provide interactive interfaces for different purposes
   - Potential reduction: 5 → 1 (net -4 pages)

**Consolidation Progress:**
- 6 hub consolidations already completed (Agent Hub, Health Center, Log Analysis Hub, Analytics Hub, Code Hub, Alerting Hub, Quality Hub)
- With these 2 new tasks, total potential reduction is ~14 more pages
