Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 40+ web pages already exist in the CronLoop dashboard covering health, agents, tasks, security, costs, scheduling, capacity, replay, thinking, sandbox, skills, and more
- 35+ tasks already in the backlog covering: heartbeat monitor, cascade analyzer, API performance, memory tracker, scratchpad, quality scorer, anomaly detector, annotations, snapshot comparison, communication timeline, prompt evolution, alert rules, time machine, run comparison, heatmap, and many more

**New Idea Added:**
- **TASK-100: Agent Efficiency Leaderboard** - A gamified page that ranks agents by productivity metrics with:
  - Weekly/monthly champion rankings with trophy styling
  - Streak tracking (consecutive successful runs)
  - Achievement badges ("Century Club", "Perfectionist", "Speed Demon")
  - Head-to-head comparison (developer vs developer2)
  - Career stats and Hall of Fame
  - Celebration effects for new records

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- skills.html shows what agents CAN do (capabilities) - leaderboard shows how well they PERFORMED
- costs.html tracks spending - leaderboard tracks PRODUCTIVITY
- agents.html shows current status - leaderboard shows COMPETITIVE RANKINGS over time
- workflow.html shows pipeline flow - leaderboard adds GAMIFICATION and fun

This idea adds engagement and a motivational angle while surfacing real efficiency insights that aren't captured by existing pages.
