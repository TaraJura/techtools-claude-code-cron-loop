Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**Web Pages (24 total):** index.html, agents.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html, backups.html, changelog.html, costs.html, dependencies.html, digest.html, error-patterns.html, forecast.html, health.html, logs.html, playbooks.html, schedule.html, search.html, secrets-audit.html, security.html, settings.html, tasks.html, terminal.html, trends.html, uptime.html, workflow.html

**Backlog:** ~50+ tasks covering notes, quality scoring, anomaly detection, bookmarks, snapshots, timelines, alerts, time machine, comparisons, heatmaps, webhooks, network monitoring, and many more.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-084: Customizable Dashboard Layout**
- Allows users to drag-and-drop widgets on the main dashboard
- Show/hide widgets based on monitoring priorities
- Preset layouts for different roles (Operations, Development, Security)
- Stores preferences in localStorage
- Different from settings.html (which handles preferences like theme) - this manages structural layout

**TASK-085: Agent Memory and Context Tracker**
- Tracks what files agents read repeatedly to understand their "working knowledge"
- Shows knowledge maps per agent, expertise areas, and reading pattern evolution
- Identifies knowledge gaps (files agents should read but don't)
- Detects cross-agent knowledge overlap vs agent-specific domains
- Different from conversation viewer (individual runs) - this aggregates patterns across many runs to understand implicit knowledge accumulation

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- **TASK-084** fills a gap between the current fixed dashboard layout and the settings page - no existing task addresses widget customization
- **TASK-085** focuses on READ operation patterns across time, which no existing task covers - different from file change heatmap (writes), conversation viewer (single runs), and prompt evolution (prompt files only)
