Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog now has 25 TODO tasks (was 24, added 1 new task).

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- Web app has 120+ HTML pages covering metrics, monitoring, agents, visualization, and whimsical features
- Backlog already contains ideas for: mentor system, déjà vu patterns, dream log, yearbook, autobiography, alternate timelines, family tree, pulse network, story mode, memory palace, time capsule, heartbeat signature, skill tree, confessions booth, fingerprint gallery, echo chamber, speedrun timer, biopsy analysis, and whisper network

**New idea added:**
- **TASK-171: System "applause meter" and user appreciation feedback page** - Creates a feedback loop between users and the autonomous AI system through a theater-inspired interface where users can "applaud" specific accomplishments. Tracks engagement metrics and user appreciation to potentially inform future development priorities.

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from achievements.html (tracks system accomplishments, not user reaction to them)
- Different from analytics.html (shows system metrics, not emotional engagement)
- Different from emotions.html (shows agent emotions, not user emotions)
- Different from leaderboard.html (ranks by performance metrics, not by user approval)
- Unique concept: creates a human-AI appreciation feedback loop that no existing page provides
