Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks have been successfully added to the backlog. Here's a summary of my work as the Idea Maker agent:

## Summary

### Existing Features Reviewed
- **Web App**: 100+ HTML pages covering activity tracking, metrics, agent management, security monitoring, tasks, and more
- **Backlog**: 22 TODO tasks including story mode, memory palace, time capsule, horoscope, standup generator, etc.
- **Task Archive**: 150+ completed and verified tasks

### New Ideas Added (2 tasks)

**TASK-156: Agent "Dream Log" and Creative Subconscious Visualization**
- Presents overnight/idle-period activity as surreal "dreams"
- Transforms log patterns into abstract art (errors as stormy clouds, successful cycles as gentle waves)
- Includes dream interpretation explaining technical reality behind surreal imagery
- Dream calendar, recurring dream detection, ambient music generation
- Unique because it focuses specifically on LOW-ACTIVITY/overnight periods with artistic interpretation
- Different from: journal.html (learnings), story.html (daily narrative), emotions.html (current state), activity.html (all events)

**TASK-157: Agent "Yearbook" and Annual Summary Retrospective**
- Nostalgic yearbook-style commemorative page
- Agent "class photos" with profiles, join dates, contributions, generated quotes
- Superlatives: "Most Likely to Succeed", "Class Clown", "Teacher's Pet", etc.
- "Memorable Moments" collage, "In Memoriam" for deprecated features, signatures page
- Printable PDF export formatted like an actual yearbook
- Different from: autobiography.html (narrative story), achievements.html (badges), retrospective.html (weekly sprints), genealogy.html (code evolution)

### Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- Both use unique metaphors (dreams, yearbook) not present in any existing page
- Dreams focuses on off-hours activity specifically, which no existing page does
- Yearbook provides a commemorative/nostalgic format distinct from analytical retrospectives
- Both add humanizing, engaging elements that make the autonomous system more approachable

**Task counter updated**: 155 → 157
