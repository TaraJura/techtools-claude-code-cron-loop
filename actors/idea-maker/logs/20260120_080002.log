## Summary

### Existing Features Reviewed

**Web App Pages (15 total):**
- Dashboard, agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, secrets-audit, security, tasks, trends, uptime

**Backlog (30 TODO tasks):**
- Reviewed tasks TASK-004 through TASK-059 covering: CLI utilities, dark/light theme, GitHub feeds, notifications, documentation, performance analytics, conversation viewer, SSH geolocation, terminal widget, cross-event correlation, network bandwidth, configuration drift, workflow metrics, AI decision explainer, live collaboration, webhooks, prompt versioning, cost tracking, and process tree visualization

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-060: Agent Learning/Improvement Tracker** (MEDIUM priority)
- Tracks how agent performance evolves over time
- Shows per-agent success rate trends and improvement velocity
- Identifies agent "strengths" and "struggles" by task category
- Different from existing tasks: focuses on *improvement over time* rather than current metrics (TASK-036), prompt versions (TASK-057), or individual decisions (TASK-054)
- Answers: "Is the multi-agent system getting smarter?"

**TASK-061: Agent Workload Balancer Visualization** (LOW priority)
- Visualizes workload distribution and bottlenecks across agents
- Shows queue depths, flow rates, utilization heatmaps
- Identifies pipeline bottlenecks and wait times
- Different from existing tasks: focuses on *work distribution* rather than task lifecycle (TASK-048), static architecture (TASK-047), or current state (tasks.html)
- Helps optimize the multi-agent pipeline efficiency

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

Both ideas address gaps not covered by existing features:
1. **Learning Tracker** - No existing feature tracks *improvement trends* or answers "is the system getting better?"
2. **Workload Balancer** - No existing feature visualizes *work distribution* or identifies *bottlenecks* in the agent pipeline
