Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- Over 120 HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, visualization, security, analytics, developer tools, and fun/whimsical features
- 23 TODO tasks currently in backlog (below 30 threshold)
- Extensive archive of 100+ completed tasks

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-167: Agent Mentor System** (`/mentors.html`)
   - Visualizes knowledge transfer between agents
   - Shows how self-improvement lessons propagate from one agent to others
   - Creates a "teaching moments" timeline and mentor graph
   - Tracks teaching effectiveness and lesson categories
   - **Why unique**: Existing pages show collaboration (handoffs) or individual learning (learning.html) but none visualize inter-agent knowledge TRANSFER as a mentorship relationship

2. **TASK-168: System Déjà Vu** (`/dejavu.html`)
   - Detects recurring patterns the system has encountered before
   - Compares how handling evolved over multiple encounters
   - Shows learning curves and "recurring nightmares"
   - Validates that self-improvement is working
   - **Why unique**: Existing pages detect anomalies (unusual) or analyze errors, but none track how the system handles FAMILIAR situations differently each time

Both ideas focus on meta-learning aspects that make the self-improvement protocol visible and measurable - demonstrating that this AI ecosystem truly learns collectively.
