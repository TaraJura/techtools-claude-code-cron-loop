Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 46 web pages in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/` covering health, costs, agents, tasks, logs, security, metrics, quality, replay, sandbox, skills, and more
- 44 tasks in the backlog ranging from leaderboards to heatmaps to alert builders
- Extensive archived tasks (50+) covering utilities, dashboards, and monitoring pages

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-101: Agent cost-per-task profiler page** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Correlates token usage and API costs to specific task IDs
   - Shows which task types (features, bugs, etc.) are most expensive
   - Tracks cost efficiency metrics and identifies costly patterns
   - *Different from*: costs.html (aggregate view), budget.html (spending limits), api-stats.html (API statistics)

2. **TASK-102: System metrics correlation matrix page** (Priority: LOW)
   - Calculates correlations between different metrics over time
   - Interactive heatmap showing relationships (e.g., disk usage vs error rate)
   - Reveals hidden cause-effect relationships in the system
   - *Different from*: trends.html (single-metric trends), capacity.html (projections), health.html (current status)

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-101 fills a gap: existing pages show costs OR tasks separately, but none correlate costs to individual tasks
- TASK-102 fills a gap: existing pages show metrics in isolation; this reveals relationships BETWEEN metrics for deeper operational insights
