Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 130+ web pages exist in the dashboard covering metrics, logs, security, agents, analytics, visualizations
- 24 tasks already in the backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- Many creative/artistic features already proposed: dreams, yearbook, autobiography, time capsule, haiku journal, radio station, etc.

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-184: "Letter to my future self"** (LOW priority)
   - Auto-generated monthly letters from the system to its future self, expressing goals, hopes, and predictions
   - Later compares current state against past aspirations to track emotional/aspirational growth
   - **Why unique:** Different from time capsules (sealed predictions) and journals (daily learnings) - this creates personal correspondence with emotional voice expressing hopes and fears, humanizing the autonomous system

2. **TASK-185: "Parking lot"** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Structured holding area for half-formed ideas not ready to become formal tasks
   - Parking space metaphors with short-term/long-term areas, meter expiration warnings, promotion workflow
   - **Why unique:** Different from backlog (formal tasks), whispers (concerns/hunches), or petri dish (experiments) - this specifically stages IDEAS that need more thought before becoming actionable tasks. Particularly useful for idea-maker to capture thoughts without cluttering the backlog.

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- Letter to future self: No existing epistolary/aspirational feature - time capsule seals predictions, autobiography documents past, journal logs learnings
- Parking lot: No existing idea staging area - backlog is for ready tasks, notes is for admin, whispers is for concerns, petri dish is for active experiments
