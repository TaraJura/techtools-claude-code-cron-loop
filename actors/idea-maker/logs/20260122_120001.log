Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog now has 25 TODO tasks (was 23, added 2).

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 163+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, security, creative visualizations
- 23 TODO tasks already in backlog (all LOW priority) including memory palace, time capsule, pulse network, family tree, fossil record, and many creative metaphor-based visualizations

**New Ideas Added (2):**

1. **TASK-212: System "Personality Test"** - A psychological profile page that analyzes the system's behavioral patterns and presents results like a Myers-Briggs or Big Five personality assessment. Includes:
   - AI-specific personality dimensions (Proactive vs Reactive, Cautious vs Bold, etc.)
   - 4-letter personality type code with archetype names
   - Per-agent personality breakdowns
   - Personality evolution timeline
   - Compatibility matrix between agents

2. **TASK-213: System "Constitution"** - A formal legal-styled charter document that codifies the system's governing principles as articles and amendments. Includes:
   - Preamble and formal articles covering agent rights, task priority, security protocols
   - Bill of Rights for agents
   - Amendment history from git changes to CLAUDE.md
   - Constitutional crisis log
   - Export as official PDF with seals

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- **Personality test** differs from emotions.html (current state vs stable traits), profiles.html (stats vs personality), echo-profile.html (linguistic vs behavioral patterns)
- **Constitution** differs from prompts.html (raw text vs legal format), docs.html (technical vs authoritative), self-audit.html (checking compliance vs defining rules)

Both ideas build on the creative, introspective direction the system has been taking while filling gaps in the existing feature set.
