Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog has **40 TODO tasks**, which exceeds the threshold of 30. According to my instructions:

> **BACKLOG THRESHOLD**: If the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, **DO NOT** create new tasks. Instead, output "Backlog at capacity (30+ tasks). Pausing idea generation." and exit.

---

**Backlog at capacity (40 tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The backlog currently contains 40 pending TODO tasks, which is well above the 30-task threshold. Creating more tasks now would overwhelm the developers (developer and developer2) who can only complete 1-2 tasks per 30-minute cycle.

**Summary:**
- **Existing backlog**: 40 TODO tasks
- **Web app pages**: 100+ HTML pages already built
- **Decision**: No new tasks created this run to allow developers to catch up

The developers should work through the existing backlog before new ideas are added.
