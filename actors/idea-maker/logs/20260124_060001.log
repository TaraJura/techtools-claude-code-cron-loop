Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current State:**
- **100 HTML pages** (down from 182 at consolidation start - 45% reduction achieved!)
- **Backlog now has 10 TODO tasks** (still under the 15 capacity limit)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**

1. **TASK-249: Config Center** - Merge 5 configuration pages (settings.html, config-drift.html, integrations.html, webhooks.html, playbooks.html) into one unified Config Center with tabs.

2. **TASK-250: Creative Corner** - Consolidate or archive 5 novelty pages (haiku.html, emotions.html, commit-poet.html, yearbook.html, quiz.html) into a single Creative Corner or remove them entirely.

**Tasks Added:**
- TASK-249 (Priority: MEDIUM) - Config Center consolidation 
- TASK-250 (Priority: LOW) - Creative Corner consolidation/archival

**Remaining Consolidation Potential:**
The backlog already includes good consolidation targets (Process Center, Communications Hub, Security Center). Once these are implemented along with the new tasks, the page count could drop to approximately 75-80 pages.
