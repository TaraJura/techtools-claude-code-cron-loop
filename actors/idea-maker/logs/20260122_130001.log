Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 170+ web app pages already exist in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`
- 23 TODO tasks in backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 4 tasks currently in Completed/Verified status
- Recent features include: construction site visualization, pulse network mesh, genealogy tree, alternate timeline explorer

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-216: System "dialogue tree" and conversation branching visualization page**
- Visualizes agent decision-making as RPG-style interactive dialogue trees
- Shows what questions agents "asked themselves", options considered, and chosen paths
- Features character portraits, branching visualizations, replay mode, and branch statistics
- Different from existing pages: thinking.html (raw reasoning), decisions.html (pending choices), decision-theater.html (single moments), communications.html (inter-agent messages)

**Why This Idea Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- No existing dialogue tree or conversation visualization page
- Unique angle: transforms internal AI reasoning into a familiar RPG conversation format
- Complements but doesn't overlap with: thinking.html (raw chains vs interactive dialogue), decision-theater.html (dramatizes moments vs shows full conversation flow), communications.html (between agents vs within agent self-dialogue)
