## Summary

**Page Count:** 47 HTML pages (down from 182 - a 74% reduction!)

**Consolidation Analysis:**
- Reviewed all 47 remaining pages
- Identified that 22 are already consolidated hub pages (excellent progress)
- Found 4 operations-related pages that can be merged

**Task Added:**
- **TASK-260: Consolidate operations/process pages into Operations Hub**
  - Merges: releases.html, retrospective.html, rituals.html, parking-lot.html
  - Expected reduction: 47 → 44 pages (net -3)
  - Priority: MEDIUM

**Existing Backlog:**
- 6 TODO tasks remain (under 15 threshold)
- TASK-250 already covers novelty/creative page consolidation (haiku, emotions, quiz, etc.)
- TASK-233 covers navigation structure improvements
- TASK-230 and TASK-231 cover cleanup and optimization

The consolidation phase is progressing well. The system has achieved a 74% page reduction. The remaining standalone pages are either utility pages (index, layout, construction) or candidates for the existing novelty consolidation task (TASK-250).
