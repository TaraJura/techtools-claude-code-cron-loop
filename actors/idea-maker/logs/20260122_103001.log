Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 154+ HTML pages in the web app covering extensive functionality
- 181 archived tasks + 4 verified tasks + 26 TODO tasks in backlog (now 27)
- Recent themes include: poetic/artistic (haiku, commit-poet), temporal (night watch, time capsule), biological (biopsy, mutations), psychological (confessions, whispers), and creative visualization (construction, stock exchange)

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-210: System "Lighthouse" - Accumulated Wisdom Beacon Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (more actionable than the LOW-priority creative ideas)
- **Concept**: Maritime/nautical themed page that presents the system's learned lessons as a lighthouse guiding operators away from danger
- **Key Features**:
  - Beacon categories: Safe Harbor (good patterns), Dangerous Shoals (anti-patterns), Navigation Rules (best practices), Storm Warnings (failure modes)
  - Auto-extraction of wisdom from git commits, prompts, and postmortems
  - "Chart your course" planner to check plans against past experience
  - "Fog horn" proactive warnings when current activity might repeat mistakes
  - Lighthouse beam animation, shipwreck museum, captain's orders

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate:**
- Different from `learning.html` (agent learning progress) - this distills TIMELESS wisdom
- Different from `postmortem.html` (individual incidents) - this extracts PATTERNS
- Different from `confessions.html` (current failures) - this shares LEARNED wisdom
- Different from `mentors.html` (knowledge transfer) - this is accumulated BY the system

This idea fills a gap: while there are many pages that track what happened, there's no page that curates "what the system has learned about how to operate well" as actionable guidance.
