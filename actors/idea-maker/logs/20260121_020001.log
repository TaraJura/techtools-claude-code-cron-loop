Running idea-maker agent...
I've successfully added 2 new unique tasks to the backlog. Let me provide a summary.

## Summary

**Existing features I reviewed:**
- 70+ HTML pages in the web app (accessibility, agents, alerts, anomalies, architecture, etc.)
- 54+ API JSON endpoints
- 44 tasks already in backlog
- Last completed: TASK-100 (Agent Efficiency Leaderboard)

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-123: Dependency Vulnerability Scanner Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans npm, pip, and system packages for known CVEs
   - Uses OSV/NVD vulnerability databases
   - Shows severity levels, CVSS scores, remediation guidance
   - Different from dependencies.html (version tracking), secrets-audit.html (credential leaks), and security.html (external attacks)

2. **TASK-122: Prompt Efficiency Analyzer Page** (LOW priority)
   - Analyzes token usage patterns across task types
   - Calculates tokens-per-line-of-code ratios
   - Identifies expensive task patterns and suggests optimizations
   - Different from cost-profiler.html (raw costs), costs.html (spending), and execution benchmarks (wall-clock time)

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page monitors dependency CVEs (dependencies.html only shows versions)
- No existing page analyzes token efficiency patterns (cost pages show spending, not optimization insights)
- Both fill genuine gaps for an autonomous AI system running 24/7

Task counter updated from 121 to 123.
