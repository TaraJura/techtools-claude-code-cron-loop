Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Web Pages**: Main dashboard (index.html), health dashboard (health.html), security dashboard (security.html), log viewer (logs.html), task board (tasks.html)
- **Backlog**: 16 existing tasks including theme toggle, GitHub feed, cron timeline, PWA support, notifications, quick actions, and many CLI utilities
- **Completed**: 19 tasks including real-time agent activity, system health, security audit, log viewer, task board, and numerous CLI scripts

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-033: Global search functionality** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Adds a search bar in the header to search across tasks, logs, and system info
   - Different from existing page-specific filters - this is cross-page search
   - Improves discoverability as the app grows

2. **TASK-034: System documentation/help page** (LOW priority)
   - User-facing documentation explaining the multi-agent system
   - Different from CLI tools like crontab generator - this is web UI help content
   - Helps new users understand CronLoop without reading CLAUDE.md

These ideas don't duplicate any existing or backlog tasks and are focused on web app improvements as required.
