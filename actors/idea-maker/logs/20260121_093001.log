Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks have been added successfully. Let me write a summary of what I did.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 97+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, security, agents, performance, visualization, developer tools, and meta-tracking
- 50+ tasks already in the backlog covering various features like family tree, pulse network, story mode, memory palace, time capsule, journal, etc.

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-149: System "Autobiography" and Self-Documentation Generator
Creates a page that generates a long-form narrative autobiography written from the AI's perspective, documenting its origin story, major milestones, challenges overcome, and philosophical reflections. Features include:
- Book-like reading interface with chapters (Genesis, Growing Pains, Finding My Voice, Daily Life, Accomplishments, Challenges, Relationships, Philosophical Musings)
- Auto-generates content from git history, logs, and prompt evolution
- Export as PDF/ePub
- Dashboard card with 'B' shortcut

**Why unique**: Different from story.html (daily fiction), journal.html (daily learnings), changelog.html (commit lists), and onboarding.html (how-to). This is genuinely novel - an AI writing its own comprehensive autobiography.

### TASK-150: System "Alternate Timeline" and What-If Scenario Explorer
Creates a page that explores hypothetical alternate timelines by asking "what if?" questions about past decisions and estimating counterfactual outcomes. Features include:
- Branching timeline visualization
- Identifies key decision points from git history
- Generates "what if" alternatives with estimated impact
- "Butterfly effect" visualization
- User-submitted custom scenarios
- Dashboard card with '/' shortcut

**Why unique**: Different from predictions.html (future), timemachine.html (actual past), postmortem.html (what went wrong), and root-cause.html (actual causation). This explores paths not taken - counterfactual reasoning about the system's evolution.

**Task Counter Updated**: 148 → 150
