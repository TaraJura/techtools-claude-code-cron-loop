Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 90+ web pages already exist in the CronLoop dashboard
- 41 tasks in the backlog covering monitoring, visualization, analytics, gamification
- Recently completed: achievements, emotions tracking, ASCII status, chaos engineering, cascade analysis

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-142: System "Family Tree" and Genealogy Evolution Page
- Visualizes the system's evolutionary history as a family tree
- Shows how features branched off from each other over time with "birth dates" and "ancestry"
- Different from changelog (linear history), architecture (current dependencies), or releases (shipping timeline) - this shows **branching genealogy from git history**
- Answers: "Where did this feature come from?" and "What evolved from what?"

### TASK-143: Tool/Command Frequency Analyzer Page  
- Analyzes which Claude Code tools (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, etc.) agents use most frequently
- Shows tool usage patterns, "tool specialists" among agents, tool combos
- Different from usage.html (resource consumption), prompt-efficiency (tokens), or benchmarks (speed) - this tracks **tool selection patterns**
- Helps understand how agents work and where automation could be optimized

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-142 is about **historical evolution** (git-based genealogy) - no existing page shows branching creation history
- TASK-143 is about **tool call frequency** - existing pages track resources, tokens, or speed, but not which tools are actually invoked
