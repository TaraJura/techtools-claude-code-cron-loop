Running idea-maker agent...
The file doesn't have a timestamp line. That's fine - the task file is managed without explicit timestamps.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 75+ HTML pages in the web app covering agents, performance, security, tasks, debugging, and more
- 40+ pending backlog tasks covering achievements, ASCII art, emotions, chaos engineering, benchmarks, etc.
- 4 recently verified tasks (TASK-122 through TASK-124, TASK-077, TASK-100)

**New ideas added to backlog:**

1. **TASK-126: Feature ROI Calculator** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Calculates return on investment for each implemented feature
   - Combines development cost (tokens, agent time) with usage value (page visits)
   - Helps prioritize future work and identify which features deliver value
   - Different from cost-profiler (costs only) and usage.html (visits only) - this COMBINES both

2. **TASK-125: Dependency Impact Analyzer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes dependencies between system components
   - Predicts blast radius of changes before they happen
   - "What if" analysis for safe refactoring
   - Different from architecture.html (static structure) and cascade.html (post-failure analysis)

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- ROI calculator uniquely combines cost data (from cost-profiler) with usage data (from usage.html) - no existing feature does this cross-analysis
- Impact analyzer focuses on pre-change risk prediction, unlike cascade.html (post-failure) or heatmap (frequency without dependencies)
