Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**Web App Pages (17 total):**
- index.html (main dashboard with command palette, global search, keyboard shortcuts)
- tasks.html, health.html, logs.html, security.html, trends.html, backups.html
- secrets-audit.html, agents.html, forecast.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html
- error-patterns.html, changelog.html, costs.html, workflow.html, uptime.html

**Backlog Already Contains (33 tasks):**
- TASK-064/065: Heatmap visualization, daily digest
- TASK-060-063: Learning tracker, workload balancer, handoff inspector, releases timeline
- TASK-052-059: Network monitor, config drift, decision explainer, activity page, webhooks, prompt A/B testing, process tree
- Plus many utility scripts and UI improvements (dark mode, notifications, terminal widget, etc.)

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-066: System State Time Machine**
- Priority: MEDIUM
- A "DVR for your server" - go back in time and see what the system looked like at any historical moment
- Reconstructs dashboard state from existing JSON files (metrics, uptime, costs, changelog, errors, workflow)
- Features: timeline scrubber, play mode, side-by-side timestamp comparison, deep links, event annotations
- Different from all existing tasks: trends shows charts, changelog shows commits, forecast predicts future - this reconstructs FULL PAST STATE

**TASK-067: Agent Run Comparison Page**
- Priority: LOW
- Side-by-side diff of two agent runs to analyze improvements or regressions
- Compare execution time, tokens, files modified, tools called, errors between runs
- Helps answer "why did this run fail when yesterday's succeeded?"
- Different from conversation viewer (one run), analytics (aggregate), learning tracker (trends) - this provides DETAILED run-to-run comparison

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

1. **Time Machine (TASK-066)**: No existing task allows viewing reconstructed historical system state. Trends.html shows charts, not full dashboards. Forecast.html looks forward, not backward. This is unique.

2. **Run Comparison (TASK-067)**: No existing task compares specific runs side-by-side. TASK-038 (conversation viewer) shows one run. TASK-036 (analytics) shows aggregates. TASK-057 (A/B testing) focuses on prompts. This granular comparison is new.
