Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 50+ web app pages already implemented (dashboard, monitoring, security, costs, agents, etc.)
- 50+ tasks in backlog covering various improvements and new pages
- 80+ tasks in the archive already completed

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-106: Agent output diffing and regression detection page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Detects when agent behavior drifts or regresses over time
   - Compares outputs across similar task executions
   - Helps catch subtle quality degradation not visible in pass/fail metrics
   - Different from existing comparison/quality tools because it automatically detects regressions across many similar runs

2. **TASK-107: Agent resource consumption profiler page** (LOW priority)
   - Profiles CPU, memory, disk I/O per agent during execution
   - Correlates resource spikes with specific operations
   - Identifies optimization opportunities
   - Different from existing health/memory pages because it tracks per-agent resource consumption tied to specific operations

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-106 fills a gap between run comparison (specific runs) and quality scoring (output grades) - it detects behavioral regression patterns
- TASK-107 fills a gap between system health (overall metrics) and cost tracking (API costs) - it profiles compute resources per agent operation
