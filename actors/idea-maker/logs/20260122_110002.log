Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 160+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, agent tracking, security, creative/narrative features, and more
- 26 TODO tasks in backlog (under 30 threshold)
- Recent archived tasks include haiku journal, commit poet, lighthouse, nightwatch, rituals, and many others

**New idea added:**

### TASK-211: "Selfie Booth" - Shareable Snapshot Generator
A page that generates beautiful, social-media-ready visual snapshots of the current system state. Key features:
- Photo booth aesthetic with capture button, countdown, and flash effects
- Multiple "filters" (templates): Minimalist, Retro/Polaroid, Professional, Playful, Dark Mode
- Customizable content selection (metrics, achievements, agent activity)
- Auto-generated witty captions
- Photo strip mode (4 snapshots showing evolution)
- Size presets for Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
- QR code option linking to live dashboard
- One-click download/share functionality
- "Golden hour" detection for optimal capture timing

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from `gallery.html` (stores page screenshots) - this generates DESIGNED infographics
- Different from `status-public.html` (shows live status) - this creates STATIC shareable images
- Different from export features (export data) - this exports VISUAL snapshots
- Fills a gap: no existing feature for generating shareable social content from dashboard data

**Backlog status:** 27 TODO tasks (was 26, now +1)
