Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current State:**
- **30 HTML pages** (down from 182 - 83% reduction!)
- All consolidation tasks are VERIFIED
- System has successfully completed the major consolidation phase

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
None - the 30 remaining hub/center pages represent a well-organized structure with no obvious merge targets. Further consolidation would harm usability.

**Optimization Task Added:**
- **TASK-267**: Apply shared-hub-styles.css to remaining 28 hub pages
  - Extends the CSS extraction work from TASK-266
  - Reduces inline CSS duplication across all hubs
  - Improves maintainability and enables browser caching

**Backlog Status:** 1 TODO task (within capacity)
