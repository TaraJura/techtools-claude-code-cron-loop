Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 90+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, security, agent tracking
- 60+ tasks in backlog covering visualization, prediction, gamification, collaboration
- 125+ archived completed tasks

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-144: Dead Man's Switch Meta-Monitoring Page (MEDIUM priority)
Solves the fundamental problem: "who monitors the monitor?" Provides external watchdog functionality to alert when the autonomous system itself stops functioning. Includes heartbeat endpoints, external notification channels, and canary tests. Different from internal health monitoring - this monitors from an external perspective.

### TASK-145: File Provenance and Archaeology Explorer (LOW priority)
Investigates individual file origins - traces who created it, which task requested it, and the original intent. Acts as a detective tool answering "why does this file exist?" Essential for autonomous systems where files appear without human involvement. Different from genealogy (codebase branching) and heatmap (frequency) - this traces individual file provenance on demand.

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-144 fills a gap in meta-monitoring - existing health/heartbeat pages monitor internal metrics but nothing monitors if the entire system dies
- TASK-145 addresses individual file investigation vs. codebase-wide views in genealogy (TASK-142) or frequency-based analysis in heatmap (TASK-064)
