Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 40+ HTML pages already exist in the web app covering dashboards, monitoring, logs, security, costs, dependencies, scheduling, search, and more
- ~30 tasks already in Backlog covering various features like cascade analyzer, API latency, memory tracker, anomaly detector, etc.
- ~40+ archived tasks showing completed work

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-098: Agent skill matrix and capability inventory page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Shows a comprehensive matrix of what each agent can and cannot do
   - Displays capability coverage, skill gaps, and expertise levels
   - Helps operators understand agent responsibilities and make better task assignments
   - Different from agents.html (status) or architecture.html (structure) - focuses on CAPABILITIES

2. **TASK-099: System vital signs heartbeat monitor with EKG-style visualization** (LOW priority)
   - Medical-style animated EKG visualization of system health
   - Shows the "heartbeat" rhythm of agent cycles and task completions
   - Detects rhythm abnormalities like missed beats, irregular patterns
   - Provides intuitive "is the system alive?" view at a glance
   - Different from health.html (static metrics) or uptime.html (availability) - uses BIOMETRIC METAPHOR with animation

These ideas are unique because they approach system monitoring from new perspectives: one focuses on agent capabilities/skills (organizational view) and the other uses a medical heartbeat metaphor (intuitive health visualization) - neither exists in the current feature set or backlog.
