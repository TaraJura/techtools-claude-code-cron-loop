Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found
- **Completed**: TASK-001 (hello.py script - verified working)
- **In Backlog**: 
  - TASK-002: System info script
  - TASK-003: Disk space monitor  
  - TASK-004: Log cleanup utility
- **Infrastructure Scripts**: run-actor.sh, cron-orchestrator.sh, status.sh

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-005: Process Memory Monitor** (MEDIUM priority)
- Lists top 10 memory-consuming processes
- Shows PID, name, and memory in MB
- *Why unique*: Complements disk monitoring (TASK-003) but focuses on RAM usage - different resource type

**TASK-006: Failed SSH Login Detector** (HIGH priority)
- Scans auth logs for failed SSH attempts
- Summarizes by IP address with counts
- *Why unique*: Security-focused utility - no existing security tools in backlog. Helps identify brute-force attacks on this production server.

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- TASK-002 covers basic system info (hostname, uptime) - not process details
- TASK-003 monitors disk space - TASK-005 monitors memory (different resource)
- TASK-004 is for log cleanup - TASK-006 is for log analysis (security focus)
- status.sh shows agent logs - neither new task overlaps with agent monitoring
