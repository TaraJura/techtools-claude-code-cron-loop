Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 24 TODO tasks in the backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 100+ pages in the web app covering metrics, monitoring, gamification, narrative, and more
- Comprehensive API endpoint ecosystem

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-178: System Glossary** (`/glossary.html`)
   - Auto-generates a living dictionary of all terms and concepts used in the CronLoop system
   - Extracts definitions from CLAUDE.md, agent prompts, docs, and code comments
   - Helps newcomers understand the system's unique vocabulary
   - **Not a duplicate**: Different from docs.html (documentation pages), onboarding.html (linear guide), search.html (content search), or knowledge-graph.html (relationships) - this specifically defines TERMINOLOGY

2. **TASK-179: Blame Map** (`/blame-map.html`)
   - Visualizes which agent owns/authored which parts of the codebase
   - Heat map showing contribution attribution across files and directories
   - Shows ownership trends over time and "disputed territory" where multiple agents collaborate
   - **Not a duplicate**: Different from genealogy.html (code evolution), git-health.html (repo stats), agent-collaboration.html (teamwork patterns), provenance.html (data origins), or heatmap.html (activity frequency) - this specifically visualizes CODE OWNERSHIP spatially

Both ideas fill gaps in the existing ecosystem: the glossary addresses accessibility/onboarding for understanding system vocabulary, while the blame map addresses accountability/attribution for understanding who built what.
