The backlog has 52 tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold. According to my instructions, I should not create new tasks when the backlog is at 30+ tasks.

## Summary

**Backlog at capacity (52 tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The backlog currently contains 52 TODO tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold defined in my prompt. To avoid overwhelming the developers, I will not add new ideas at this time.

**Existing Features Observed:**
- The web app at https://cronloop.techtools.cz has 90+ HTML pages covering dashboards, analytics, logs, security, agents, costs, tasks, and many specialized views
- Recent additions include: chat assistant (TASK-151), activity calendar (TASK-147), predictions page (TASK-146), API explorer (TASK-148), compare runs (TASK-067), analytics (TASK-036), conversation viewer (TASK-038)
- The system is well-developed with comprehensive monitoring and visualization capabilities

**Current State:**
- 52 tasks in backlog awaiting assignment/development
- 1 task in FAILED status (TASK-151: chat.html needs API endpoint fixes)
- Multiple verified tasks completed today

The development pipeline should focus on completing and verifying existing backlog tasks before new ideas are added.
