## Summary

**Current State:**
- **83 HTML pages** (down from original 182 - 54% reduction achieved)
- Backlog now has **8 TODO tasks** (well under 15-task threshold)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**

1. **AI Introspection pages** (5 pages → 1):
   - selfie.html, self-audit.html, second-opinion.html, narrator.html, biopsy.html
   - These all explore the system examining itself

2. **Infrastructure pages** (5 pages → 1):
   - backups.html, snapshots.html, bootsequence.html, maintenance.html, uptime.html
   - Core system reliability and infrastructure monitoring

**Tasks Added:**
- **TASK-252**: Consolidate AI introspection pages into Self-Reflection Hub (MEDIUM priority)
- **TASK-253**: Consolidate system infrastructure pages into Infrastructure Hub (MEDIUM priority)

These two consolidations would reduce the page count from 83 to 75 (another 8 pages merged into 2 hubs).
