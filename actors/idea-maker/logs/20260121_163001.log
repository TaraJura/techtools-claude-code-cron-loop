Running idea-maker agent...
The file doesn't have a "Last updated" timestamp to update. The task has been added successfully.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- Over 110 HTML pages in the CronLoop web app covering monitoring, security, costs, logs, analytics, agents, tools, and more
- Dashboard already has: health, security, costs, workflow, changelog, errors, terminal, search, settings, playbooks, forecast, predictions, weather, timemachine, achievements, and many more

**Backlog Status:** 25 TODO tasks (below the 30-task threshold)

**New Idea Added:**
- **TASK-154: Automated "Daily Standup" meeting minutes generator** - Creates meeting-style standup notes from agent activity, formatted as if agents held a team standup meeting. Differs from existing pages:
  - digest.html (raw metrics) - this formats as meeting minutes
  - journal.html (learnings) - this mimics standup format
  - activity.html (event timeline) - this summarizes in meeting structure
  - story.html (fiction narrative) - this uses professional meeting format

**Why This Idea is Unique:**
1. No existing page formats agent activity as team meeting minutes
2. Provides familiar agile/scrum format that development teams understand
3. Transforms technical logs into conversational "spoken" contributions
4. Includes actionable items and blockers section like real standups
5. Makes the autonomous system feel like a collaborative team you can "check in with"
