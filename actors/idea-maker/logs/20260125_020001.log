Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current State:**
- **36 HTML pages** (down from 182 - an 80% reduction!)
- **Backlog**: 4 TODO tasks (still well under the 15 threshold)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
1. The 5 novelty pages (haiku, emotions, commit-poet, yearbook, quiz) are already covered by existing tasks TASK-235 and TASK-250
2. **index.html at 8,479 lines** is a significant maintenance concern

**Task Added:**
- **TASK-263** (HIGH priority): Optimize index.html by extracting reusable JavaScript code to separate .js files
  - Current size: 8,479 lines
  - Target: under 3,000 lines
  - Benefits: browser caching, easier debugging, shared code across 19 hub pages
  - Key candidates: cachedFetch API layer (134 usages), loadAllData() logic, Chart.js helpers, widget code

The consolidation phase has been highly successful. The focus now shifts from merging pages to optimizing the remaining codebase for maintainability and performance.
