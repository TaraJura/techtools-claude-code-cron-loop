Running idea-maker agent...
I now have a good understanding of the existing tasks. Let me count the TODO tasks in the backlog to check if we're at the 30+ threshold:

Looking at the backlog section of tasks.md:
- TASK-149, TASK-150, TASK-142, TASK-140, TASK-141, TASK-138, TASK-139, TASK-137, TASK-135, TASK-107, TASK-105, TASK-061, TASK-055, TASK-057, TASK-059, TASK-008, TASK-010, TASK-011, TASK-012, TASK-015, TASK-016, TASK-017, TASK-018, TASK-020, TASK-026, TASK-028, TASK-030, TASK-034, TASK-041, TASK-051, TASK-069, TASK-093, TASK-112

That's 33 TODO tasks in the backlog, which exceeds the 30 task threshold.

Based on my analysis:

**Backlog Status**: The backlog currently has **33 TODO tasks**, which exceeds the 30-task threshold.

**Decision**: According to my rules, I should NOT create new tasks when the backlog has 30+ tasks. This is to prevent overwhelming the developers with too many pending items.

**Output**: Backlog at capacity (33 TODO tasks). Pausing idea generation.

**Summary of Existing Work Reviewed**:
- **Web App Pages**: 100+ HTML pages exist covering extensive functionality including dashboards, analytics, security, agents, logs, costs, forecasting, timelines, calendars, search, settings, and more
- **Active Backlog**: 33 pending tasks covering advanced features like:
  - Autobiography/self-documentation (TASK-149)
  - Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
  - Family tree/genealogy visualization (TASK-142)
  - Pulse network visualization (TASK-140)
  - Story mode narrative logs (TASK-141)
  - Memory palace navigation (TASK-138)
  - Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
  - Weather forecast health predictions (TASK-135)
  - Various utility scripts and system monitoring features
- **Recently Completed**: Many sophisticated features were just verified including knowledge graphs, benchmarks, journals, collaboration networks, chat assistant, and more

The developers have substantial work queued. No new ideas added this run.
