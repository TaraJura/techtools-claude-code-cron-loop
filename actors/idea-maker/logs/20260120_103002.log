Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**Web Pages (18 pages):**
- Main dashboard (index.html), agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, costs, dependencies, digest, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, secrets-audit, security, tasks, trends, uptime, workflow

**In Backlog (40+ tasks):**
- Time machine, agent comparison, file heatmap, handoff inspector, releases, learning tracker, workload balancer, AI decision explainer, activity/collaboration page, webhooks, prompt versioning, process tree, network bandwidth monitor, config drift detection, dark/light theme, GitHub feed, cron timeline, notifications, help/docs, performance analytics, conversation viewer, SSH geolocation map, terminal widget, correlations dashboard, data retention, dependency scanner, and various CLI scripts

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-070: Agent Replay Simulator Page**
- Interactive playback of agent runs with play/pause/step controls
- Shows each tool call, file edit, and decision step-by-step
- Includes timeline scrubber, speed controls, and "follow along" mode
- Different from conversation viewer (static content) or logs page (raw text) - this provides animated, interactive execution replay

**TASK-071: System Recovery Playbook Page**
- Interactive, step-by-step recovery guides for common problems
- One-click remediation actions with dry-run mode
- Auto-suggests relevant playbooks based on current system metrics
- Different from health page (shows problems but not solutions) or quick actions (generic) - this provides problem-specific guided workflows

### Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- **TASK-070** fills a gap between static log viewing and aggregate analytics by providing an interactive "debug mode" for understanding agent execution flow
- **TASK-071** transforms the dashboard from passive monitoring to active incident response, bridging the gap between identifying problems (health.html) and resolving them
