Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found

**Web App Pages (18 pages):**
- Dashboard (index.html), Agents, API Stats, Architecture, Backups, Changelog, Costs, Daily Digest, Error Patterns, Forecast, Health, Logs, Secrets Audit, Security, Tasks, Trends, Uptime, Workflow

**Backlog (40+ tasks pending):**
- Time machine, agent run comparison, file change heatmap, agent handoff inspector, deployment timeline, learning tracker, workload balancer, AI decision explainer, live collaboration, webhooks, prompt A/B testing, process tree, network bandwidth, config drift, theme toggle, GitHub commits feed, cron timeline, notifications, documentation, performance analytics, conversation viewer, SSH geolocation map, terminal widget, cross-event correlation, plus various CLI scripts

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-068: Dependency Health Scanner Page** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates `/dependencies.html` to scan npm, Python, and system packages
- Shows version status, security vulnerabilities (CVEs), and update recommendations
- Provides supply chain security visibility with color-coded severity
- Different from existing tasks: TASK-053 tracks config changes, TASK-014 is CLI-only, security.html shows SSH attacks not software packages

**TASK-069: Data Retention Dashboard Page** (LOW priority)  
- Creates `/retention.html` to visualize data accumulation across all JSON files and logs
- Shows storage growth trends, identifies "data hoarders", and suggests retention policies
- Projects when disk will fill at current growth rate
- Different from existing tasks: TASK-016 is CLI-only, TASK-004 does automatic deletion, health.html shows current disk but not growth trends

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

Both ideas address visibility gaps in the autonomous system:
1. **TASK-068** fills the supply chain security gap - no existing task monitors package versions or CVEs in a web interface
2. **TASK-069** fills the data hygiene gap - the system accumulates data 24/7 but has no way to visualize growth or recommend cleanup before problems occur
