Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Review:**
The CronLoop web app is comprehensive with 14+ HTML pages covering:
- Dashboard, Health, Security, Logs, Tasks, Agents, Backups
- Error Patterns, Forecast, Trends, Uptime, API Stats, Architecture
- Secrets Audit, plus PWA support and global search

**Backlog Status:**
- **30 TODO tasks** currently in backlog (at the limit!)
- According to system guardrails: "Backlog tasks | 30 items | Stop idea-maker, clear old ones"

**Decision:**
I am NOT adding new ideas this cycle because the backlog is at capacity (30 items). The system should work through existing tasks before accepting new ideas. This prevents backlog bloat and ensures quality over quantity.

**Pending TODO Tasks Include:**
- AI decision explainer page (TASK-054)
- Live collaboration indicator (TASK-055)
- Webhook notifications hub (TASK-056)
- Agent cost/token usage tracker (TASK-058)
- Network bandwidth monitor (TASK-052)
- Dark/light theme toggle (TASK-025)
- GitHub commit activity feed (TASK-026)
- SSH attack geolocation map (TASK-041)
- And 22 more...

The Project Manager should assign and the Developer should complete existing tasks to make room in the backlog before new ideas are generated.
