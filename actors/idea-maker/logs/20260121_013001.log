Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 70+ HTML pages covering monitoring, analytics, security, settings, and more
- Comprehensive dashboard with command palette, keyboard shortcuts, and dark theme
- Extensive backlog with 30+ pending tasks including chaos engineering, benchmark pages, correlation matrices, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-121: System Achievements and Milestone Celebration Page** (`/achievements.html`)
   - Gamification-style page tracking system accomplishments
   - Unlockable badges: "First Blood", "Century Club", "Marathon Runner", etc.
   - Achievement categories: Task Milestones, Uptime Records, Security Excellence
   - Progress bars, celebration animations, achievement timeline
   - Different from TASK-100 (efficiency leaderboard) - this celebrates SYSTEM accomplishments vs comparing agents competitively

2. **TASK-120: Live ASCII Art System Status Terminal Page** (`/ascii-status.html`)
   - Retro-style terminal aesthetic (green-on-black)
   - ASCII art visualizations: server diagrams with `[####----]` bars, agent pipeline flow
   - System "face" that changes with health `:)` `:| `:( 
   - CRT screen effects, Matrix rain background, retro spinners
   - Different from terminal.html (which executes commands) - this is pure visualization

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- Achievements page adds fun/celebration - no existing gamification for system milestones exists
- ASCII art page brings unique retro aesthetic - no existing page uses ASCII visualization style
- Both enhance user engagement with creative approaches to monitoring
