Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary - Idea Maker Run Complete

### Existing Features Reviewed

The CronLoop web app already has 16 pages covering:
- **System monitoring**: health, trends, forecast, uptime, costs
- **Agent visibility**: real-time status, logs, config viewer, architecture graph
- **Security**: dashboard, secrets audit, error patterns
- **Task management**: Kanban board, changelog/audit trail
- **API/Operations**: rate limiting, backups

### New Ideas Added (2 unique tasks)

**TASK-062: Agent Handoff Inspector** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates `/handoffs.html` to visualize how agents communicate through tasks.md
- Tracks the data flow chain: idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → security
- Shows timeline of each task's journey with handoff delays
- Identifies failed handoffs and friction points
- **Why unique**: Existing pages show static architecture (TASK-047) or workflow metrics (TASK-048), but none visualize actual agent-to-agent data passing

**TASK-063: Deployment/Release Timeline** (LOW priority)
- Creates `/releases.html` to track what features shipped when
- Associates completed tasks with git tags/releases
- Generates automatic release notes from task descriptions
- Shows release velocity trends and unreleased features
- **Why unique**: changelog.html shows all commits, tasks.html shows current status - but nothing tracks RELEASES as a concept for communicating progress

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work

- TASK-062 fills the gap between architecture.html (static dependencies) and workflow metrics (time tracking) by showing actual communication flow
- TASK-063 fills the gap between changelog.html (all commits) and tasks.html (task status) by tracking the shipping/release perspective
