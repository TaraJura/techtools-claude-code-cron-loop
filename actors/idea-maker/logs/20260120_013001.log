Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz):**
- `index.html` - Main dashboard with agent status, quick actions, system overview
- `tasks.html` - Kanban-style task board viewer
- `logs.html` - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- `health.html` - System health dashboard (CPU, memory, disk)
- `security.html` - Security audit dashboard
- `trends.html` - System resource trends/history with sparklines

**CLI Scripts in /home/novakj/projects/:**
- 13 utility scripts (system-info, disk-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, service-status-checker, file-permission-auditor, package-update-checker, config-backup, system-metrics-api)

**Backlog already contains:** 18 pending tasks covering themes like theme toggle, GitHub commits, PWA support, notifications, search, documentation, and analytics.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-037: Backup Status Dashboard Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates `/backups.html` showing backup overview
   - Displays last backup date, size, and available archives
   - Integrates with existing `config-backup.sh` script
   - "Create Backup Now" button via Quick Actions
   - **Why unique**: CLI backup tool exists but no web visibility into backup status

2. **TASK-038: Agent Conversation Viewer Page** (LOW priority)
   - Creates `/conversations.html` with chat-bubble format
   - Parses agent logs to show Claude's reasoning and tool calls
   - Searchable and filterable by agent/date
   - **Why unique**: logs.html shows raw log files; this PARSES them into readable conversations showing what Claude thought and did
