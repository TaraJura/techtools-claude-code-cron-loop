Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features I Found:**
- **17 web pages**: index, agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, costs, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, secrets-audit, security, tasks, trends, uptime, workflow
- **18+ API endpoints**: system-metrics, agent-status, security-metrics, costs, changelog, workflow, api-stats, error-patterns, uptime-history, etc.
- **12 CLI scripts** in /home/novakj/projects/
- **30+ tasks** already in backlog covering: decision explainer, webhooks, prompt versioning, process tree, network bandwidth, config drift, dark theme, GitHub feed, cron timeline, notifications, docs, analytics, conversation viewer, geolocation map, terminal widget, correlation dashboard, handoff inspector, release timeline, learning tracker, workload balancer, and more

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-064: File Change Heatmap Visualization** (LOW priority)
   - Visualizes which files/directories are modified most frequently
   - Treemap showing "hot zones" (active development) vs "cold zones" (stable)
   - Filter by agent or file type
   - Identifies churn patterns and architectural stability
   - Different from changelog (linear list) and releases (feature tracking)

2. **TASK-065: Daily Agent Digest Report Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Generates consolidated daily summary of all agent activity
   - Sections: tasks created/assigned/completed, tests run, security issues, costs
   - Highlights notable events and problems
   - Export as email, markdown, or PDF
   - Historical digest archive
   - Different from webhooks (real-time alerts) and trends (charts)

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- The heatmap provides a spatial/visual view of code changes that no existing page offers - changelog shows commits linearly, this shows them as a code-geography heatmap
- The daily digest fills a gap for stakeholders who want a quick text summary rather than watching dashboards or real-time feeds - it's a curated daily briefing, not raw data
