Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Ideas Generation Complete**

I reviewed the existing work to avoid duplicates:
- **tasks.md**: 23 TODO tasks in backlog (below 30-task threshold)
- **Web app**: 161+ existing HTML pages covering monitoring, analytics, agents, creativity features, and more
- **Archived tasks**: Historical completed tasks (too large to fully review, but active tasks were sufficient)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-219: Campfire - Storytelling Sessions Page** (LOW priority)
   - Transforms daily operational data into narrative stories told around a virtual campfire
   - Features agent character arcs, plot structure, dramatic tension tracking, and moral lessons
   - Different from existing pages: narrator.html (live narration), autobiography.html (factual history), story.html (timeline), journal.html (learnings), haiku.html (poetry)
   - Makes monitoring entertaining rather than obligatory

2. **TASK-220: Greenhouse - Feature Seedling Incubation Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes ideas and features as plants in a greenhouse environment
   - Shows growth stages: seed → sprout → sapling → flowering → full bloom
   - Health indicators (wilting for stalled, vibrant for active), sunlight/water metrics for attention/resources
   - Different from: construction.html (building metaphor), petri-dish.html (experiments), task-graph.html (dependencies)
   - Encourages patient, nurturing development practices

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- Campfire provides NARRATIVE entertainment, not status updates or documentation
- Greenhouse uses BOTANICAL growth metaphor for feature lifecycle, not construction/building or experiment metaphors
- Both bring new visual metaphors and engagement patterns to the dashboard
