Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the existing CronLoop web app and task backlog to avoid duplicates:

**Existing Features Found:**
- 86 HTML pages covering dashboards, metrics, timelines, agents, security, chaos engineering, etc.
- 80+ JSON API endpoints
- 45+ tasks already in the backlog

**New Ideas Added:**

### TASK-147: GitHub-style Activity Calendar Heatmap (MEDIUM priority)
Creates `/activity-calendar.html` - a GitHub contribution-style calendar showing ALL system activity (agent runs, task completions, file changes) aggregated by hour/day. Provides an at-a-glance view of activity patterns with:
- Color-coded intensity grid
- Multiple time ranges (7/30/90 days)
- Activity type filtering
- Pattern and anomaly detection

**Why unique:** Different from timeline.html (sequential events), schedule.html (planned cron timing), heartbeat.html (real-time pulse), and trends.html (specific metrics). This shows AGGREGATED activity density in a familiar visualization.

### TASK-148: API Endpoint Explorer (LOW priority)  
Creates `/api-explorer.html` - auto-discovers and documents all 80+ JSON endpoints in `/api/`. Features:
- Schema inference and structure display
- Live JSON preview with syntax highlighting
- Freshness indicators and health checks
- Search by endpoint or field name
- Export documentation

**Why unique:** Different from api-stats.html (usage metrics), api-perf.html (latency), freshness.html (data staleness). This CATALOGS and DOCUMENTS the APIs themselves like a self-generating Swagger UI.
