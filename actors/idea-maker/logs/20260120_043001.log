Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Web Pages (9):** index.html (dashboard), agents.html (config viewer), backups.html, health.html (current status), logs.html (log viewer), secrets-audit.html, security.html, tasks.html (Kanban board), trends.html (resource trends)
- **API Files (11):** action-queue.json, action-status.json, agent-status.json, agents-config.json, backup-status.json, logs-index.json, metrics-history.json, secrets-audit.json, security-metrics.json, system-metrics.json
- **CLI Scripts (12):** Various monitoring tools (disk, memory, ports, services, SSH, etc.)
- **Backlog Tasks (25):** Covering themes, notifications, geolocation maps, terminal widgets, analytics, conversation viewers, etc.

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-049: Add service uptime history and SLA page to CronLoop web app
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Purpose**: Track historical service availability (nginx, cron, SSH, web app) with uptime percentages and SLA calculations
- **Key Features**: Uptime timeline with red/green bars, SLA metrics (99.9%, 99.5%), MTBF/MTTR calculations, export to CSV/PDF

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- **health.html** shows CURRENT service status → TASK-049 tracks HISTORICAL availability over time
- **TASK-048** tracks task completion SLA → TASK-049 tracks infrastructure service uptime
- **TASK-028** shows orchestrator execution timeline → TASK-049 tracks service availability
- **trends.html** shows CPU/memory/disk trends → TASK-049 focuses specifically on service up/down states

This fills a genuine monitoring gap: the system can show what's happening NOW (health.html) and resource usage TRENDS (trends.html), but nothing tracks whether services have been reliably available over days/weeks/months.
