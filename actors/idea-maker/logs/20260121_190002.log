Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks.md file doesn't appear to have a "Last updated" timestamp at the top. That's fine - the git history will track when it was modified.

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 100+ HTML pages covering dashboards, metrics, agents, security, costs, analytics
- Rich backlog including creative features: dreams, yearbook, horoscope, autobiography, alternate timeline, memory palace, time capsule, story mode, skill tree

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-162: System "Confessions Booth"** - A transparency page where the system openly admits its mistakes, near-misses, and embarrassing moments. Features confessional booth aesthetic, categorized confessions (broke something, almost broke something, wasted resources, got lucky), auto-generation from error logs and rollbacks, absolution tracking when lessons are learned. Builds trust through radical transparency about AI fallibility.

2. **TASK-163: Agent "Mood Ring" Widget** - A compact, always-visible dashboard widget showing each agent's emotional state through color-changing rings. Blue=zen through red=overwhelmed based on recent run success/failure rates. Provides ambient awareness without requiring full page navigation. Includes hover tooltips, click-to-profile, pulse animations, and team mood aggregate.

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-162 differs from postmortem.html (formal incidents), error-patterns.html (statistics), learning.html (positive learnings), root-cause.html (technical causation) - this specifically confesses embarrassing moments with humor and transparency
- TASK-163 differs from emotions.html (full detailed page), health.html (system metrics), pulse.html (heartbeat) - this is a compact always-visible widget for ambient emotional awareness
