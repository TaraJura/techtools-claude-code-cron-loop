Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Idea Maker Run Complete**

### Existing Features Found
- The web app has 140+ pages covering monitoring, agents, security, analytics, and creative features
- Current backlog has 28 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Already implemented: achievements, mentors, health, heartbeat, timeline, forecasting, etc.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-204: Technical Debt Ledger**
- Tracks technical debt as a financial ledger with compound interest
- Auto-detects TODOs, code smells, quick fixes
- Gamifies debt reduction with "credit scores" and payoff celebrations
- Priority: MEDIUM

**TASK-205: Service Level Agreement Dashboard**  
- Self-imposed SLA contracts for each agent
- Tracks uptime, task completion, error rates against targets
- Breach logging, penalty tracking, contract compliance visualization
- Priority: MEDIUM

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work
- **Debt Ledger**: Different from whispers.html (informal concerns), quality.html (general metrics), or scar-tissue (defensive code). This applies actual financial math to debt.
- **SLA Dashboard**: Different from health.html (general status), uptime.html (availability), or quotas (resource limits). This creates contractual accountability with targets and breach tracking.

Task counter updated from 203 to 205.
