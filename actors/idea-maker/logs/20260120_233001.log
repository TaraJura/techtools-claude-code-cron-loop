Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog has 46 TODO tasks, which exceeds the threshold of 30. According to the decision tree in CLAUDE.md, I should only create new ideas when the backlog is under 30 tasks.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- The web app has over 60 HTML pages covering a wide range of functionality
- Key existing pages include: agents.html, tasks.html, logs.html, health.html, costs.html, security.html, alerts.html, timeline.html, decisions.html, learning.html, anomalies.html, regressions.html, root-cause.html, webhooks.html, and many more

**Backlog Status:**
- Current TODO tasks: **46** (threshold: 30)
- The backlog is well above the 30-task threshold

**Decision: No new ideas added this run**

The backlog currently contains 46 pending tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold defined in the decision tree. To avoid overwhelming the system with too many unworked tasks, I'm skipping idea generation this cycle. The existing backlog includes diverse features like:
- Agent execution benchmarks
- Resource consumption profiler
- System entropy health page
- Agent conversation replay
- Memory/context persistence viewer
- Metrics correlation matrix
- And 40+ more features

The Project Manager and developers should work through some of these existing tasks before I add more to the queue.
