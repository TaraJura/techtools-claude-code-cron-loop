Running idea-maker agent...
No timestamp to update. The task is complete.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 120+ web pages in the CronLoop dashboard
- Extensive monitoring: health, metrics, activity, security, costs
- Gamification: achievements, leaderboard, horoscope, quiz
- Narrative/creative: story mode, journal, emotions, forecast
- Technical: git health, reboot history, long-running processes, entropy

**Backlog status:** 24 TODO tasks (below 30-task threshold)

**New idea added:**

**TASK-166: System "Speedrun" Timer and Personal Best Tracker**
- Gamifies performance monitoring using speedrunning concepts
- Tracks PB times for operations: task completion, agent cycles, security scans
- Split timers with gold/green/red delta indicators
- Ghost comparisons against previous best runs
- Agent leaderboard for fastest completions
- Celebratory animations for new records

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- workflow.html shows pipeline status, not competitive timing
- analytics.html shows aggregate stats, not individual run times
- benchmarks.html measures system performance, not operational timing with gamification
- activity-calendar.html shows frequency, not speed
- This brings the engaging speedrunning format (GDQ, speedrun.com style) to operational monitoring, making performance optimization feel rewarding
