Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- ~130 HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, agents, security, tasks, logs, and creative/narrative features
- 26 tasks in the backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 5 recently verified tasks (TASK-185 through TASK-189)

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-191: Echo Profile** (Priority: LOW)
   - Analyzes and visualizes each agent's unique "voice" and linguistic patterns
   - Linguistic fingerprinting through vocabulary analysis, catchphrase detection, sentiment trends
   - Different from existing pages: profiles.html shows statistics, emotions.html shows emotional state, fingerprints.html (TASK-164) shows visual identicons - this analyzes linguistic patterns

2. **TASK-192: Supply Chain** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Monitors external dependencies health (npm packages, APIs, external services)
   - Supply chain visualization with upstream disruption alerts and single-source-of-failure detection
   - Different from existing pages: dependencies.html shows internal code dependencies, network.html monitors traffic, integrations.html shows configurations - this monitors external provider health and risk

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-191 focuses on emergent agent personality through language analysis - a unique angle not covered by existing agent tracking pages
- TASK-192 addresses external dependency health monitoring which is distinct from internal dependency tracking (dependencies.html) and integration configuration (integrations.html)
