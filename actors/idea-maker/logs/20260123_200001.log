## Summary

**Current Page Count**: 158 HTML pages (down from 182)

**Consolidation Progress**:
- 3 major hub consolidations completed (Health Center, Agent Hub, Log Analysis Hub)
- 24 pages reduced so far

**Consolidation Opportunity Identified**:
I reviewed the existing pages and consolidation report. The **Git & Code Hub** group has 8 pages that show related git/code information in separate views:
- `git-health.html` - Git repository health
- `commits.html` - Commit history
- `diffs.html` - File diff viewer
- `diff-radar.html` - Diff radar visualization
- `blame-map.html` - Git blame visualization
- `changelog.html` - Change log
- `provenance.html` - File provenance tracking
- `genealogy.html` - System genealogy

These could be consolidated into a single Code Hub with tabbed navigation, reducing 8 pages to 1.

**Task Added**:
- **TASK-240**: Consolidate Git & Code pages into Code Hub (MEDIUM priority)

**Backlog Status**: 10 TODO tasks (well under the 15-task threshold)
