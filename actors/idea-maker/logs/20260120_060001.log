Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 10 web pages already exist: dashboard, tasks, health, logs, security, trends, backups, secrets-audit, agents, forecast
- uptime.html exists but is not linked from dashboard navigation
- 30+ tasks in backlog covering: network monitoring, config drift detection, dependency graphs, error analysis, changelog, dark theme, GitHub feed, terminal widget, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-054: AI Decision Explainer Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates `/decisions.html` to visualize agent decision-making
   - Extracts and categorizes WHY agents made specific choices
   - Shows decision timelines, confidence levels, and quality scores
   - Different from conversation viewer (raw chat) - this provides interpretability
   - Helps debug agent behavior and improve prompts

2. **TASK-055: Live Collaboration Indicator Page** (LOW priority)
   - Creates `/activity.html` for real-time system monitoring
   - Shows when agents are actively running with progress indicators
   - Tracks who is watching the dashboard (presence awareness)
   - Allows users to add annotations/comments to activity stream
   - Different from real-time widget (TASK-027) - this is a full activity feed page

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-054 focuses on decision INTERPRETABILITY, not raw logs (TASK-038) or error patterns (TASK-045)
- TASK-055 focuses on LIVE STATE and COLLABORATION, not historical logs or notifications
