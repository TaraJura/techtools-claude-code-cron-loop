Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog currently has exactly 30 TODO tasks. According to my rules, if the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, I should **not** create new tasks to avoid overwhelming the developers.

## Summary

**Backlog at capacity (30 tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

### What I Found:
- **Backlog status**: 30 TODO tasks (at threshold)
- **Current task counter**: 209
- **Web app features**: 160+ HTML pages already exist including dashboards, monitoring tools, visualizations, and extensive functionality
- **In Progress**: No tasks currently in progress
- **Recently Completed**: TASK-209 (nightwatch.html) and TASK-206 (rituals.html) were just verified

### Existing Ideas in Backlog:
The backlog is full of creative ideas including:
- Yearbook/retrospective page (TASK-157)
- Autobiography generator (TASK-149)
- Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
- Memory palace navigation (TASK-138)
- Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
- And 25+ more unique features

No new tasks will be added this run. The developers need time to work through the current backlog before additional ideas are introduced.
