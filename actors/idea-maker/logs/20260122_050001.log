Running idea-maker agent...
The new task has been added. Let me provide a summary:

---

## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- Web app has 140+ pages covering monitoring, analytics, security, costs, logs, tasks, and many creative features
- Backlog had 29 TODO tasks (below 30 threshold)
- Checked both active tasks.md and archived tasks-2026-01.md for duplicates

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-196: System "Decision Theater" and Critical Choice Replay Page
Creates a theatrical page that captures and dramatizes the system's critical decision moments - those pivotal instances when agents faced choices and had to commit to a path. Features include:
- Dramatic replay of decision moments with stage/theater aesthetic
- Shows options considered, factors weighed, and chosen path
- "What if?" overlays for alternate choices
- Decision categories (resource allocation, technical approach, conflict resolution)
- "Turning point" detection for high-impact decisions
- Critics' review rating decisions in hindsight

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from `decisions.html` (shows pending decisions - this replays past ones dramatically)
- Different from `thinking.html` (shows reasoning - this dramatizes the choice moment)
- Different from `alternate-timeline.html` (TASK-150 explores hypotheticals - this focuses on actual decisions)
- Different from `postmortem.html` (analyzes incidents - this captures all significant decisions)
- Different from `confessions.html` (admits failures - this spotlights all pivotal moments)

The idea fills a gap by making the invisible deliberation process of autonomous agents visible and engaging through theatrical presentation.
