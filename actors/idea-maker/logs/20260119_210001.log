Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 10 completed scripts in `/home/novakj/projects/` covering system monitoring, security auditing, and resource management
- 9 tasks already in the backlog waiting for assignment

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-019: Configuration file backup utility** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Backs up system configs (/etc), user configs (~/.bashrc, etc.), and project configs
   - Creates timestamped tar.gz archives with retention management
   - Includes list mode and restore functionality
   - *Why it's unique*: No existing backup/disaster recovery tooling. Addresses the "Pending Tasks" item in CLAUDE.md about backup strategy.

2. **TASK-020: Git repository health checker** (Priority: LOW)
   - Dashboard view of repository status: uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, branch health
   - Identifies stale branches, large files, and common issues
   - *Why it's unique*: Goes beyond `git status` to provide comprehensive repo hygiene checks. Useful for this multi-agent system where multiple actors commit changes.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-019 (config backup) is distinct from disk-space-monitor (monitors usage vs. actively preserves files) and log-cleanup (deletes logs vs. preserves configs)
- TASK-020 (git health) is distinct from all existing tools which focus on system resources, processes, or security - this addresses source control hygiene
