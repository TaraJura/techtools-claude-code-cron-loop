Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- **Web App Pages:** Main dashboard (index.html), task board (tasks.html), health dashboard (health.html)
- **API Endpoints:** agent-status.json, system-metrics.json
- **CLI Tools:** 12 utility scripts covering system info, disk, memory, ports, services, security auditing, backups, package updates
- **Backlog:** 14 pending tasks covering log viewer, theme toggle, GitHub feed, timeline, plus various CLI utilities

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-029: Mobile PWA Support** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Makes dashboard installable as a mobile app
   - Adds offline caching via service worker
   - Enables monitoring on the go without browser
   - Different from theme toggle (visual only) - this adds app-like capabilities

2. **TASK-030: Browser Notification Alerts** (LOW priority)
   - Proactive alerts when errors occur or health goes critical
   - Works in background tabs
   - Rate-limited to prevent spam
   - Different from all existing read-only dashboards - this adds proactive monitoring

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- PWA support is a new capability not covered by any existing task (theme toggle is visual, responsive design is layout)
- Browser notifications add a completely new dimension of proactive monitoring not addressed by any existing feature or task
- Both enhance the user experience for remote monitoring without requiring SSH access
