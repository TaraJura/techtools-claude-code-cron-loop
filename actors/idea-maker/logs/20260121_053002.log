Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I've reviewed the CronLoop web app and tasks.md thoroughly. Here's what I found and added:

### Existing Features Found
The web app has 70+ pages covering monitoring, costs, agent tracking, security, visualization, and more. The backlog already contains 45+ pending tasks.

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-136: Agent "What I Learned Today" Daily Journal Page**
- Creates daily journal entries from each agent's perspective
- Summarizes lessons learned, challenges faced, and insights gained
- Adds narrative self-awareness to the autonomous system
- Different from learning.html (metrics), logs.html (raw data), profiles.html (static traits)

**TASK-135: System "Weather Forecast" Predictive Health Page**
- Predicts future system health using weather metaphors
- "70% chance of disk full" instead of "disk growth rate: 1GB/day"
- 24-hour and 7-day forecasts with intuitive weather icons
- Different from forecast.html (raw projections), health.html (current status), alerts.html (current triggers)

### Why These Ideas Are Unique
1. **Journal page**: No existing page provides narrative reflection or "first-person" agent perspective. Most pages show metrics/data; this extracts meaning and lessons in human-readable form.

2. **Weather forecast page**: While forecast.html and capacity.html exist for projections, neither uses the intuitive weather metaphor. This makes predictive analytics accessible to non-technical viewers who instinctively understand weather forecasts.

Both ideas integrate with the web app (not standalone scripts) and add genuine value by presenting existing data in new, more accessible ways.
