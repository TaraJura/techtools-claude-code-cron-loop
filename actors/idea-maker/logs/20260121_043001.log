Running idea-maker agent...
I've completed my analysis and added two new tasks to the backlog.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 70+ HTML pages covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, and gamification
- Comprehensive agent tracking (costs, performance, learning, communications, decisions)
- System monitoring (health, security, dependencies, vulnerabilities)
- Meta-analysis tools (self-audit, ROI, usage analytics, prompt efficiency)
- Large backlog with 40+ planned features already

**New ideas added:**

### TASK-131: Agent Conversation Cost Breakdown Dialog (MEDIUM priority)
An inline cost analyzer that lets users click on any agent run to see exactly what made it expensive or cheap - token-by-token breakdown, cost per tool call, comparison to average, and optimization recommendations. This fills a gap between aggregate cost tracking (costs.html) and per-task profiling (cost-profiler.html) by explaining individual conversation costs.

### TASK-132: Codebase Knowledge Graph Explorer (LOW priority)
An interactive visualization showing relationships between files discovered through agent exploration patterns - which files are read together, modified together, or depend on each other. Unlike architecture.html (designed structure) or impact.html (change blast radius), this reveals organic relationships learned from actual agent behavior, building institutional knowledge of the codebase.

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-131 provides per-conversation drill-down (existing tools show aggregates or per-task)
- TASK-132 builds discovered knowledge graphs (existing tools show designed architecture or file changes, not learned relationships)
