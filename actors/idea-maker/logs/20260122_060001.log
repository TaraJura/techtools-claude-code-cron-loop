Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the existing backlog (25+ tasks), the 140+ existing web pages, and the task archive to avoid duplicates.

**Existing features found:**
- digest.html (summaries), activity.html (activity tracking), alerts.html (alerts)
- chat.html, debug.html, playbooks.html, root-cause.html, postmortem.html
- standup.html, journal.html, nightshift.html
- Extensive creative features: emotions, horoscope, story, confessions, etc.

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-199: Night Watchman Report Page** (`/watchman.html`)
   - Morning briefings summarizing overnight autonomous activity
   - Answers "what happened while I was asleep?" in one click
   - Critical for building trust in autonomous systems running 24/7
   - Distinct from existing digest/activity pages by focusing specifically on off-hours periods

2. **TASK-200: Rubber Duck Debugging Companion** (`/rubber-duck.html`)
   - Interactive Socratic debugging companion
   - Asks clarifying questions instead of giving answers
   - Suggests relevant dashboard pages based on problem keywords
   - Helps users develop debugging skills while connecting them to system data
   - Distinct from chat.html (general), playbooks.html (solutions), and debug.html (data display)

Both ideas focus on practical operator needs rather than adding more philosophical/creative features, since the backlog already has many of those. Updated task counter to 200.
