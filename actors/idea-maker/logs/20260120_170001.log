Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features found:**
- 30+ web app pages already built (index.html, health.html, costs.html, replay.html, task-graph.html, etc.)
- 50+ tasks in the Backlog covering diverse features (anomaly detection, webhooks, time machine, workload balancing, etc.)
- Comprehensive API data layer with ~27 JSON endpoints

**New idea added:**

**TASK-094: Add agent "thought process" explainer page**
- Creates /thinking.html to visualize Claude's reasoning chains
- Extracts thinking patterns, conditional logic, and decision rationale from logs
- Displays reasoning as flowcharts/decision trees
- Shows confidence indicators and "reasoning pivots"
- Provides interpretability into autonomous AI decision-making

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-038 (conversation viewer) shows raw conversations - TASK-094 extracts and visualizes reasoning structure
- TASK-054 (decision explainer) focuses on tool/file choices - TASK-094 focuses on the thinking process and logical chains
- TASK-036 (performance analytics) tracks execution metrics - TASK-094 tracks cognitive patterns

This idea addresses a gap in the observability stack: understanding not just WHAT agents did, but HOW they reasoned through problems. Essential for building trust in autonomous AI systems and debugging unexpected behaviors.
