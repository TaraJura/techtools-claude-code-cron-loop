Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found:
- **24 web pages** already built: index.html (dashboard), agents.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html, backups.html, changelog.html, costs.html, dependencies.html, digest.html, error-patterns.html, forecast.html, health.html, logs.html, playbooks.html, search.html, secrets-audit.html, security.html, settings.html, tasks.html, terminal.html, trends.html, uptime.html, workflow.html
- **44 tasks in Backlog** (TODO status), 38 tasks already VERIFIED
- **12 utility scripts** in /home/novakj/projects/

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-082: Admin Scratchpad/Notes Page** (Priority: LOW)
- A simple notes page for admins to capture observations, investigation notes, and quick reminders
- Supports markdown editing, multiple notes, tagging, search, and export
- Different from bookmarks (TASK-076) which saves references to existing items - this creates new freeform content
- Different from activity annotations (TASK-055) which is shared - this is personal notes

**TASK-083: Cron Schedule Calendar Visualization** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- A visual calendar showing when all scheduled jobs (cron + systemd timers) will run
- Daily/weekly timeline views with job markers and conflict detection
- Different from TASK-011 (crontab docs CLI) and TASK-017 (systemd timer analyzer) which output text
- Different from TASK-028 (cron execution timeline) which shows historical runs - this shows future schedules
- Answers "what's about to run on my server?" visually

### Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:
1. **Notes page**: No existing note-taking or scratchpad functionality in the web app. Bookmarks save references, postmortems are structured reports - neither allows freeform note capture.
2. **Schedule calendar**: Existing tasks track historical execution (TASK-028) or list schedules as text (TASK-011, TASK-017). No visual calendar combining all scheduled jobs on a timeline showing future runs.
