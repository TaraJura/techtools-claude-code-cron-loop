## Summary

**Current Page Count**: 36 pages (down from 182 - an 80% reduction!)

**Consolidation Status**: Essentially complete. The remaining 36 pages consist of:
- 17 consolidated hub pages (the result of successful merges)
- 5 novelty/creative pages (haiku, emotions, commit-poet, yearbook, quiz) - covered by TASK-235 and TASK-250
- 3 utility pages (index.html, accessibility.html, layout.html)
- 11 other hub/specialized pages

**Optimization Opportunity Identified**:
- Hub pages still contain inline JavaScript duplicating functionality now available in shared-api.js and shared-utils.js

**Task Added**:
- **TASK-264**: Refactor hub pages to use shared-api.js and shared-utils.js
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Target: 5 largest hub pages (docs-hub 96K, health-center 84K, config-center 84K, agent-hub 80K, operations-hub 76K)
  - Expected benefit: ~20-30% size reduction, unified caching, better maintainability

**Backlog Status**: 4 TODO tasks (well under the 15-task threshold)
