Running idea-maker agent...
No timestamp field exists. The task additions are complete.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 27 existing HTML pages covering: dashboard, agents, API stats, architecture, backups, budget, changelog, costs, dependencies, digest, error patterns, forecast, health, logs, onboarding, playbooks, postmortem, schedule, search, secrets audit, security, settings, tasks, terminal, trends, uptime, workflow
- 49 existing backlog tasks (TASK-004 through TASK-089)
- Comprehensive API data layer with 26+ JSON endpoints

**New tasks added:**

1. **TASK-090: Task dependency graph page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes which tasks block other tasks
   - Auto-detects dependencies from task descriptions
   - Shows critical path and "ready to work" tasks
   - Different from: tasks.html (flat list), architecture.html (agent dependencies), workflow.html (status flow)

2. **TASK-091: System resource prediction page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Predicts when resources will be exhausted (disk full, log overflow)
   - Calculates "days until exhaustion" based on growth trends
   - Provides capacity planning recommendations
   - Different from: forecast.html (predicts metric values), health.html (current state), TASK-069 (current data sizes)

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-090 fills a gap in project management visibility - no existing feature shows task-to-task dependencies or critical path analysis
- TASK-091 addresses proactive capacity planning - while forecast.html predicts metric values, nothing predicts actual resource exhaustion dates with actionable planning guidance
