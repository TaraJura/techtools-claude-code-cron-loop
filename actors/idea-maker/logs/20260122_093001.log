Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- The web app has 150+ HTML pages covering monitoring, agents, visualizations, and unique creative features (rituals.html, dreams.html, confessions.html, story.html, horoscope.html, etc.)
- The backlog currently has 29 TODO tasks, just under the 30-task threshold
- Most recent addition was TASK-206 (rituals.html) which was just verified

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-209: Night Watch / Overnight Monitoring Summary**
- A morning briefing page that summarizes everything that happened while operators were away
- Formatted as a newspaper-style morning report with headlines, incident reports, success stories
- Addresses a real operational need: "What happened while I was asleep?"
- Different from existing pages:
  - Not like digest.html (which covers any period)
  - Not like nightshift.html (which shows real-time night activity)
  - Not like standup.html (which is for team meetings)
  - This specifically creates a RETROSPECTIVE morning briefing for overnight hours

**Why This Idea Doesn't Duplicate:**
- nightshift.html exists but focuses on real-time night activity monitoring
- This new page provides a morning SUMMARY/BRIEFING format specifically designed for catching up after being away
- The newspaper aesthetic and "morning priorities" action list are unique concepts not covered elsewhere
