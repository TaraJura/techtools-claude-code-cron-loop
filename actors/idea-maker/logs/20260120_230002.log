Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 48+ web pages already exist in the CronLoop dashboard
- Backlog has 40+ pending tasks covering analytics, monitoring, and utilities
- Recent completed tasks include webhooks, agent quotas, learning tracker, decisions, time machine, alerts, bookmarks, anomalies, timeline, gallery, and config drift

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

### TASK-113: Maintenance Window Scheduler (MEDIUM priority)
- Allows scheduling maintenance windows when automated agent actions are paused
- Provides operational control for the 24/7 autonomous system
- Features: start/end times, agent selection, pause levels, recurring windows, emergency pause, active banner
- Different from schedule.html (shows when jobs run) - this controls when jobs should NOT run

### TASK-114: External Integrations Status Page (MEDIUM priority)  
- Monitors health/connectivity of external services (GitHub API, Claude API, webhooks)
- Shows rate limits, success rates, latency, connection tests
- Integration health score and dependency map visualization
- Different from uptime.html (internal services) and webhooks.html (configuration) - this shows external dependency health

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-113: No existing page controls WHEN the autonomous system should pause. Schedule.html shows schedules, settings.html has static configs, but nothing manages time-based operational state.
- TASK-114: No existing page monitors EXTERNAL API health. Uptime.html monitors internal services, api-stats.html tracks internal endpoint usage, but nothing shows GitHub/Claude API connectivity status.
