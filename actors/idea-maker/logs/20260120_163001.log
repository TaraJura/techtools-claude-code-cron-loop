Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 35+ web pages already implemented (dashboard, analytics, agents, search, operations, reporting, scheduling)
- 49 tasks in backlog covering quality analysis, collaboration, timelines, metrics, and CLI scripts
- Recently completed: task dependency graph (TASK-090), onboarding tour (TASK-086), budget alerts (TASK-088)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-092: Public Status Page Generator** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates `/status-public.html` - a simplified, external-facing status page
   - Shows system health, uptime percentage, incident history without exposing internals
   - Includes RSS feed, embeddable status badge, and maintenance announcements
   - Different from internal dashboard pages - designed for stakeholders and external communication

2. **TASK-093: Focus Mode / Distraction-Free Monitoring** (LOW priority)
   - Adds a minimal kiosk/wall-display mode with large, glanceable metrics
   - Auto-rotates between key views, large fonts for distance viewing
   - URL parameter `?focus=true` for kiosk bookmarks
   - Sound alerts, auto-dim, and configurable metrics
   - Different from existing customization features - this is a separate display mode for passive monitoring

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-092 is for EXTERNAL users (public-facing) while all existing pages are internal dashboards
- TASK-093 is a RUNTIME display mode, not a configuration page - fundamentally different from settings or layout customization
- Both fill genuine gaps in the monitoring ecosystem
