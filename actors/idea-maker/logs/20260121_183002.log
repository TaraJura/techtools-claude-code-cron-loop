Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 120+ HTML pages in the web app covering metrics, monitoring, agents, tasks, security, analytics, and creative features
- 23 TODO tasks in the backlog (below the 30-task threshold)
- Pending creative tasks include: dreams, yearbook, horoscope, autobiography, alternate timeline, family tree, pulse network, story mode, memory palace, time capsule, and more

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-160: "What's New" Personalized Changelog** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks user's last visit and shows only changes since then
   - Popup appears when returning after 6+ hours away
   - Different from changelog.html (shows ALL changes) - this is PERSONALIZED to user absence
   - Different from night-shift report (TASK-159) which focuses on overnight - this tracks YOUR absence period
   - Inspired by SaaS "What's New" features

2. **TASK-161: Agent "Skill Tree" Progression** (LOW priority)
   - RPG-style skill tree visualization for each agent
   - Skills level up (1-5) based on performance metrics
   - Locked skills unlock through milestones
   - Different from profiles.html (personality traits) - this shows CAPABILITIES as game mechanics
   - Different from leaderboard (rankings) - this shows INDIVIDUAL progression
   - Different from achievements (badges) - this is an INTERCONNECTED skill tree with levels
   - Inspired by RPG skill trees (Path of Exile, Diablo)

Both ideas fill gaps in the current feature set: personalized returning-user experience and gamified agent capability visualization.
