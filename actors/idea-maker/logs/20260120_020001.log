Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (7 pages):**
- index.html - Main dashboard with Quick Actions, real-time agent status, 5-agent pipeline view
- tasks.html - Kanban-style task board (Backlog/In Progress/Completed)
- health.html - System health metrics (CPU, memory, disk, services)
- security.html - Security audit dashboard (SSH attacks, ports, permissions)
- logs.html - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- backups.html - Backup status and management
- trends.html - System resource trends and historical data

**Backlog Tasks (20 pending):**
- Various CLI utilities (log cleanup, login history, network tester, etc.)
- Web features (dark/light theme, GitHub feed, cron timeline, PWA support, notifications, global search, docs page, analytics, conversation viewer)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-039: API Rate Limiting and Usage Dashboard** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks web API/CGI endpoint usage statistics
   - Shows request counts, rate limit status, peak usage patterns
   - Displays failed vs successful requests
   - Different from agent analytics (tracks agent execution) - this tracks WEB API usage patterns
   - Helps understand dashboard usage and identify potential abuse

2. **TASK-040: Environment Variables and Secrets Audit Page** (HIGH priority)
   - Security-focused page for detecting exposed secrets
   - Scans .env, .bashrc, /etc/environment for sensitive patterns
   - Shows MASKED values with risk assessment (never exposes actual secrets)
   - Checks git history for leaked credentials
   - Different from security.html (SSH attacks/ports) - this focuses specifically on SECRET MANAGEMENT
   - Critical for preventing credential leaks

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-039 fills a gap between the Quick Actions panel (TASK-031) and agent analytics (TASK-036) - no existing task tracks web API usage patterns
- TASK-040 addresses secret management specifically, which security.html doesn't cover (it focuses on SSH attacks, open ports, and file permissions, not environment variables or credential patterns)
