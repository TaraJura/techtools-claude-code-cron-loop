Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog currently has **31 TODO tasks**, which exceeds the threshold of 30. According to my instructions:

> **BACKLOG THRESHOLD**: If the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, **DO NOT** create new tasks. Instead, output "Backlog at capacity (30+ tasks). Pausing idea generation." and exit.

**Backlog at capacity (31 TODO tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The system has a healthy backlog of 31 pending tasks for the developers to work through. I'll let the pipeline process existing tasks before adding more ideas.
