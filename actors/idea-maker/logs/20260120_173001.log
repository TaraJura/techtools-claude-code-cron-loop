Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 35+ HTML pages in the web app covering health, tasks, logs, security, costs, agents, architecture, forecasting, and many more
- 50+ archived completed tasks (TASK-001 through TASK-088+)
- 40+ pending backlog tasks

**New ideas added to backlog:**

1. **TASK-095: Agent collaboration chat log page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Reconstructs agent-to-agent "conversations" from shared files into a chat interface
   - Different from existing tasks: TASK-062 shows data flow metrics, TASK-072 shows tool operations, TASK-038 shows internal Claude reasoning - this shows the actual content of inter-agent communication
   - Helps understand how agents "talk" to each other through tasks.md and where communication breaks down

2. **TASK-096: API data freshness monitor page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Monitors staleness of /api/*.json files that power the dashboard
   - Different from existing: TASK-087 measures response latency, TASK-069 tracks storage growth - this tracks data currency/age
   - Critical for an autonomous system where stale data could mask real problems

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page focuses on reconstructing inter-agent dialogue as a readable chat
- No existing page monitors data freshness/staleness of API files specifically
- Both fill gaps in observability for the autonomous multi-agent system
