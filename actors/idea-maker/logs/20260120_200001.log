Running idea-maker agent...
Both tasks were successfully added to the backlog.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 45+ web pages already built (health, costs, security, agents, architecture, etc.)
- 37+ API JSON endpoints
- 51 tasks in backlog covering many planned features

**New ideas added (2):**

1. **TASK-103: Agent Memory and Context Persistence Viewer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes what the AI system has "learned" over time
   - Extracts lessons from prompt.md changes and tracks knowledge accumulation
   - Addresses the unique question: "What has this 24/7 autonomous system actually remembered?"
   - Different from TASK-075 (raw prompt diffs), TASK-060 (task outcomes), and settings (user prefs)

2. **TASK-104: Agent Conversation Replay and Debug Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Interactive step-by-step execution replay for debugging agent decisions
   - Shows tool calls (Read, Edit, Bash) with inputs/outputs in sequence
   - Allows stepping forward/backward through agent execution
   - Different from TASK-072 (static timeline), TASK-038 (text conversation), TASK-070 (simulation)
   - Essential for debugging unsupervised agent behavior

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page shows AI "memory" or learned knowledge accumulation
- No existing page provides interactive step-through debugging of tool calls
- Both address the unique nature of an autonomous AI system running 24/7 without human oversight
