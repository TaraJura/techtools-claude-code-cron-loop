Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

### Existing Features Found:
- **Web App Pages**: Dashboard (index.html), Task Board (tasks.html), Health Dashboard (health.html), System Metrics API
- **Backlog**: 13 tasks already queued including 3 web app features (log viewer, dark theme, GitHub commits)
- **Completed**: 14 tasks verified, including CLI monitoring scripts and 3 web app features

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-027: Real-time agent activity indicator (MEDIUM priority)**
- Makes the Agent Pipeline section dynamic instead of static "Idle" labels
- Shows which agent is currently running with live updates
- Displays "Last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents
- Not a duplicate: TASK-022 shows historical logs, this shows LIVE status

**TASK-028: Cron execution timeline page (LOW priority)**
- Visual timeline of cron orchestrator runs
- Success/failure indicators with color coding
- Shows which agents ran in each cycle
- Not a duplicate: Different from log viewer (TASK-022) which shows individual log contents - this shows high-level orchestrator execution history as a timeline

Both ideas are web app features that add real-time monitoring capabilities to the dashboard, following the rule that all new features must be integrated into the web interface.
