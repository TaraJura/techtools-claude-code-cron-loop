Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog has **33 TODO tasks**, which exceeds the 30-task threshold.

**Backlog at capacity (33 TODO tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

According to the rules in my prompt, I should not create new tasks when the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks. This prevents overwhelming the developers with too much work.

**Summary:**
- **Backlog status**: 33 TODO tasks (exceeds 30 threshold)
- **Existing pages**: 96+ HTML pages in the web app
- **Action taken**: No new ideas created

The developers currently have plenty of work to do. I'll wait until the backlog drops below 30 tasks before generating new ideas.
