Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Current Page Count**: 32 HTML pages (reduced from 182 - an 82% reduction!)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified**:

1. **TASK-265**: Merge `accessibility.html` and `layout.html` into Config Center
   - Both pages deal with UX configuration
   - Would add 2 tabs to existing Config Center
   - Reduces page count from 32 to 30

2. **TASK-266**: Extract shared CSS to reduce hub page duplication
   - 28 hub pages share common styling patterns
   - Create `/css/shared-hub-styles.css` similar to JS extraction
   - Expected 10-15% file size reduction per hub

**Consolidation Status**: The system has completed major consolidation successfully. The remaining 32 pages are well-organized:
- 1 main dashboard (index.html)
- 28 consolidated hub/center pages
- 2 utility pages (accessibility, layout) → targeted for TASK-265
- 1 navigation hub

The backlog now has 2 optimization tasks. The consolidation phase has achieved excellent results - from 182 scattered pages to a clean architecture of ~30 focused hub pages.
