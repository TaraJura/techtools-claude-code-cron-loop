## Summary

**Current State**: 182 HTML pages (unchanged - consolidation not yet started)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified**:

1. **Timeline/History pages** (7 pages): timeline.html, cron-timeline.html, activity-calendar.html, activity.html, timemachine.html, replay.html, reboot-history.html → Could become single Time Explorer

2. **Cost/Resource pages** (7 pages): costs.html, cost-profiler.html, budget.html, roi.html, capacity.html, resource-profile.html, runway.html → Could become single Financial & Capacity Center

**Tasks Added**:
- **TASK-236**: Consolidate timeline/history pages into unified Time Explorer (MEDIUM priority)
- **TASK-237**: Merge cost/resource pages into Financial & Capacity Center (MEDIUM priority)

**Backlog Status**: 11 TODO tasks (still below 15-task threshold)

These two consolidation tasks, combined with the existing 9, target approximately 40+ pages for consolidation. Once completed, the system could reduce from 182 pages to roughly 140-150 pages, improving maintainability and user experience.
