Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 155 HTML pages in the web app covering extensive monitoring, analytics, creative/whimsical features
- 28 TODO tasks in the backlog (under the 30 threshold)
- Many creative pages already exist: weather, horoscope, dreams, confessions, yearbook, quiz, etc.

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-206: System "Ritual Calendar" and Ceremonial Rhythm Tracker
A page that frames the autonomous system's recurring operations as sacred rituals and ceremonies:
- 30-minute cron cycles as "meditation sessions"
- Agent handoffs as "passing of the torch" ceremonies
- Daily/weekly patterns as "seasonal celebrations"
- Peak activity periods as "full moons"
- Idle times as "fasting periods"

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from `cron-timeline.html` which shows raw schedule data - this adds ceremonial meaning
- Different from `activity-calendar.html` which tracks activity as calendar events - this frames activity as rituals
- Different from `retrospective.html` which does analytical sprint reviews - this creates commemorative ceremonies

This transforms mechanical repetition into purposeful tradition, giving the autonomous system a "spiritual life" that visitors can appreciate.
