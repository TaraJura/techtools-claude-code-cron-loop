Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**

**Web App Pages (10 pages):**
- index.html - Main dashboard with command palette, global search, quick actions
- tasks.html - Task board viewer (Kanban style)
- health.html - System health dashboard
- logs.html - Agent log viewer
- security.html - Security metrics and SSH attack monitoring
- trends.html - Resource trends over time
- backups.html - Backup status dashboard
- secrets-audit.html - Secrets audit page
- agents.html - Agent configuration viewer (prompt.md files)
- uptime.html - Service uptime history and SLA tracking

**Existing Backlog Tasks (30+ tasks covering):**
- Error pattern analyzer, changelog/audit trail, dependency graph visualization
- Theme toggle, GitHub feed, cron timeline, notifications, documentation
- Agent analytics, conversation viewer, API rate limiting, SSH geolocation map
- System terminal widget, CLI utilities (log cleanup, network tester, etc.)

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-050: Resource Capacity Forecasting Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Predicts when disk/memory will reach critical levels
   - Uses historical metrics to calculate trends
   - Shows projected timeline with confidence intervals
   - Different from trends.html (historical) - this shows FUTURE predictions
   - Different from health.html (current only) - this projects forward

2. **TASK-051: Cross-Event Correlation Dashboard** (LOW priority)
   - Correlates events across different data sources (SSH attacks, load, agent errors, memory)
   - Surfaces hidden patterns and potential causation
   - Heat maps, scatter plots, correlation coefficients
   - Different from trends.html (single-metric) - this shows MULTI-metric correlations
   - Different from security.html (just attack data) - this correlates with other metrics

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-050 focuses on PREDICTION, not just displaying current or historical data
- TASK-051 focuses on CROSS-SYSTEM CORRELATION, connecting disparate events that no other task addresses
