Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 139 HTML pages in the web app covering metrics, agents, security, logs, costs, git, and many creative/artistic visualizations
- 25 tasks currently in backlog (under 30 threshold)
- Extensive archive of 160+ completed tasks

**New idea added:**

**TASK-190: System "Scar Tissue" and Defensive Code Archaeology Page**
- Visualizes the codebase's "scar tissue" - defensive code added after incidents
- Medical/surgical aesthetic showing where the system has been "wounded and healed"
- Maps defensive patterns (null checks, try-catch, fallbacks, retries) to their originating incidents
- Tracks scar age, healing status, and potential cruft
- Different from existing pages: biopsy.html examines current health metrics, fossil-record.html shows deleted code, postmortem.html analyzes incidents. This page specifically traces how past failures shaped current defensive code.

**Why this idea doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page traces defensive code patterns back to their originating incidents
- The "scar tissue" metaphor provides unique insight into codebase resilience
- Complements but differs from biopsy (current health), fossil record (deleted code), and postmortem (incident analysis)
