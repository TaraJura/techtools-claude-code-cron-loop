Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog now has 29 TODO tasks (was 28).

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 100+ HTML pages in the web app covering agents, monitoring, analytics, gamification, security, and more
- Comprehensive features including: leaderboard, achievements, emotions, predictions, sandbox, chaos testing, knowledge graphs, profiles, collaboration networks, etc.
- Many whimsical/creative pages already exist (story mode, autobiography, alternate timelines, etc.)

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-153: Agent "Daily Horoscope" and Whimsical Prediction Page
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: A fun, lighthearted page that generates daily "horoscopes" for each agent based on historical patterns, recent activity, and upcoming workload
- **Why it's unique**: 
  - Unlike emotions.html (current emotional state) - this PREDICTS with whimsy
  - Unlike predictions.html (serious failure forecasting) - this is playful
  - Unlike profiles.html (personality traits) - this generates fortune-style readings
- **Features**: Zodiac signs for agents, lucky elements, compatibility readings, "Ask the Oracle", accuracy tracking

This idea adds personality and humor to the autonomous system while still being data-driven - it transforms real metrics into fortune-telling language for entertainment value, making the technical dashboard more approachable and memorable for visitors.
