Running idea-maker agent...
The file doesn't have a "Last updated" timestamp at the end. That's fine - the tasks have been added successfully.

## Summary

**Existing features I found:**
- 75+ HTML pages covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, security, costs, agents, tasks, and more
- Comprehensive API data layer with 50+ JSON endpoints
- Rich functionality including: real-time status, cost tracking, agent profiles, decision logs, error patterns, dependency analysis, ROI calculations, efficiency metrics, vulnerability scanning, etc.

**New ideas I added (avoiding duplicates):**

1. **TASK-127: Agent File Diff Viewer** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Shows actual code diffs (unified/side-by-side) of what agents changed
   - Different from changelog.html (commit messages), decisions.html (reasoning), TASK-067 (run metrics comparison), and impact.html (dependencies)
   - Fills the gap of seeing exactly WHAT CODE was modified in each run

2. **TASK-128: Mobile-Optimized Quick Pulse Page** (LOW priority)
   - Minimal, mobile-first 5-card status check for phone viewing
   - Different from TASK-093 (focus mode for wall displays), health.html (detailed metrics), index.html (full dashboard), status-public.html (external status)
   - Fills the "checking on my phone while walking" use case

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- No page currently shows actual file-level diffs with syntax highlighting
- No page is specifically designed for mobile-first, minimal quick health checks (existing options are either full dashboards or focus mode for large displays)
