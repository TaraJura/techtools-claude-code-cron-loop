Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features I found:**
- **33+ web pages** already built including: index.html (main dashboard), agents.html, api-stats.html, architecture.html, backups.html, changelog.html, costs.html, dependencies.html, digest.html, error-patterns.html, forecast.html, health.html, logs.html, playbooks.html, postmortem.html, schedule.html, search.html, secrets-audit.html, security.html, settings.html, tasks.html, terminal.html, trends.html, uptime.html, workflow.html
- **50+ tasks** already in the backlog covering agent analytics, metrics, visualization, alerts, webhooks, time machine, comparisons, heatmaps, etc.
- **12 utility scripts** in /home/novakj/projects/

**New ideas added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-088: Cost budget and spending alerts page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Creates /budget.html for setting token/cost limits
   - Daily/weekly/monthly budgets per agent and system-wide
   - Visual progress bars, burn rate calculations, alert thresholds
   - "Pause on budget exceeded" option for cost control
   - **Why unique**: costs.html shows historical spending, but there's no way to set LIMITS or ALERTS on spending - critical for production autonomous systems running 24/7

2. **TASK-089: Agent failure cascade analyzer page** (LOW priority)
   - Creates /cascade.html showing failure propagation analysis
   - Maps dependency chain: idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → security
   - Calculates "blast radius" when agents fail
   - "What if" simulation for resilience planning
   - **Why unique**: Existing tasks cover individual agent errors and performance, but nothing traces how failures PROPAGATE through the pipeline - essential for understanding system resilience

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-088 differs from costs.html (historical tracking), TASK-058 (usage tracking), and forecast.html (resource prediction) by providing BUDGETING and LIMITS
- TASK-089 differs from TASK-047 (static architecture), TASK-062 (normal handoffs), TASK-081 (anomaly detection), and error-patterns.html (individual errors) by analyzing FAILURE CHAINS and CASCADE effects
