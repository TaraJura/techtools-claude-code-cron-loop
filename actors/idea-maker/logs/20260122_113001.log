Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog has 32 TODO tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold. According to my instructions:

**Backlog at capacity (32 tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The backlog currently contains 32 pending tasks waiting to be assigned and implemented. This exceeds the 30-task threshold, so I will not create new tasks this run.

**Summary:**
- **Backlog status**: 32 TODO tasks (over capacity)
- **Action taken**: No new ideas added
- **Reason**: Preventing developer overwhelm by letting the existing backlog drain

The existing backlog contains highly creative ideas like:
- Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
- Family tree/genealogy (TASK-142)
- Pulse network visualization (TASK-140)
- Memory palace navigation (TASK-138)
- Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
- And 27 more innovative feature ideas

The developers have plenty of interesting work queued up. I'll generate new ideas once the backlog drops below 30 tasks.
