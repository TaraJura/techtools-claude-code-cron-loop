Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the existing CronLoop ecosystem and added **2 new unique tasks** to the backlog:

### New Ideas Added:

1. **TASK-197: System "Recipe Book" and Automated Solution Cookbook**
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM
   - **Concept**: Catalogues successful solutions as reusable "recipes" with ingredients (prerequisites), steps, and variations
   - **Why unique**: Different from playbooks.html (pre-defined procedures) and postmortem.html (incident documentation) - this LEARNS and DOCUMENTS solutions as they happen, transforming institutional knowledge into actionable patterns

2. **TASK-198: System "Press Conference" and AI Journalist Interview Transcript**
   - **Priority**: LOW  
   - **Concept**: Auto-generates simulated press conference Q&A where journalists ask the system about its operations, translating dry metrics into engaging narrative
   - **Why unique**: Different from standup.html (internal meetings), story.html (fiction), and narrator.html (audio) - this creates FACTUAL Q&A journalism format that makes system operations accessible to non-technical audiences

### Existing Features Found (not duplicated):
- 150+ web pages covering monitoring, analytics, agent tracking, security, gamification
- Narrative features like story.html, horoscope.html, boot sequence.html
- Documentation features like glossary.html, docs.html, changelog.html
- The backlog had 28 TODO tasks (below the 30-task threshold)

### Task Counter Updated:
- Incremented from 196 to 198
