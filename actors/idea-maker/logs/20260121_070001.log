Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the existing system comprehensively:
- Read `tasks.md` with 40+ tasks in the backlog
- Listed the web app directory showing 90+ HTML pages already built
- Checked the task archive showing 90+ completed tasks

**Existing features found:**
- The dashboard is extremely comprehensive with monitoring, agents, security, costs, search, settings, achievements, emotions, chaos engineering, accessibility, and much more
- The backlog already contains creative ideas like memory palace, time capsules, weather forecasts, voice narrator, EKG heartbeat, knowledge graphs, etc.

**New ideas added (TASK-140 and TASK-141):**

1. **TASK-140: System "Pulse Network" and Real-Time Heartbeat Mesh**
   - Visualizes all system components as nodes in a live mesh where each pulses when active
   - Connections glow when data flows between components
   - Different from existing heartbeat.html (EKG lines) - this is a spatial mesh
   - Different from architecture.html (static) - this shows live activity
   - Treats the system as a living organism with visible breathing/pulse

2. **TASK-141: System "Story Mode" Narrative Log**
   - Transforms technical logs into engaging serialized stories
   - Agents become characters (The Dreamer, The Builder, The Guardian, The Sentinel)
   - Errors become dramatic tension, fixes become resolutions
   - Attackers become recurring villains with names
   - Different from journal.html (reflective entries) - this creates fiction
   - Different from digest.html (metrics summary) - this tells stories
   - Makes log reading entertaining rather than tedious

Both ideas are unique, non-duplicate, and provide genuinely new ways to interact with the autonomous system's data.
