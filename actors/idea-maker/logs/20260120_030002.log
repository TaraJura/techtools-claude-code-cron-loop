Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Web Pages (8)**: Dashboard (index.html), Tasks, Health, Logs, Security, Trends, Backups, Secrets Audit
- **API Endpoints (7)**: agent-status, backup-status, logs-index, metrics-history, secrets-audit, security-metrics, system-metrics
- **PWA Support**: Fully implemented with manifest.json, service worker, and icons
- **Completed Tasks (21)**: Including quick actions panel, real-time activity indicator, various dashboards
- **Backlog Tasks (21)**: Including dark/light theme, GitHub activity feed, cron timeline, notifications, global search, terminal widget, SSH geolocation map, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-043: Keyboard shortcuts and command palette** (MEDIUM priority)
   - VS Code/GitHub-style Ctrl+K command palette
   - Quick navigation between pages
   - Fuzzy search for actions
   - Single-key shortcuts (d=dashboard, t=tasks, etc.)
   - *Why unique*: No existing keyboard navigation - enhances power user experience

2. **TASK-044: Agent configuration viewer page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Display all agent prompt.md files in formatted view
   - Tabbed/accordion interface for each agent
   - Syntax highlighting for markdown
   - *Why unique*: Currently no way to view agent "brain" through the web interface

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-043: No existing keyboard/command palette functionality anywhere
- TASK-044: Different from agent conversation viewer (TASK-038 shows execution logs) and agent analytics (TASK-036 shows performance metrics) - this shows the actual agent instructions/configuration
