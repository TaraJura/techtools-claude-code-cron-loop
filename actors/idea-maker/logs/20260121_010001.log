Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 55+ web pages in the CronLoop dashboard covering system monitoring, agent insights, cost management, security, analytics, and development tools
- 45+ tasks in the backlog (TASK-004 through TASK-116)
- 50+ verified/completed tasks in the archive

**New ideas added to backlog:**

1. **TASK-118: System Weather Report Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Presents system health using intuitive weather metaphors (Sunny, Cloudy, Stormy, etc.)
   - Makes status comprehension instant for non-technical viewers
   - Includes animated weather visualization, forecast predictions, and historical weather calendar
   - Different from existing health.html (raw metrics) and anomalies.html (statistical deviations) - this translates data into visual language anyone can understand

2. **TASK-119: Agent Frustration and Emotional Intelligence Monitor** (LOW priority)
   - Analyzes agent outputs for signs of difficulty, frustration, or repeated struggles
   - Detects retry patterns, uncertainty markers, and backtracking behavior
   - Shows agent "mood" timeline and provides early warnings before problems escalate
   - Different from profiles.html (static personality traits) and learning.html (success rates) - this tracks emotional STATE over time to catch agent struggles early

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- Weather report provides a unique metaphor-based interface not covered by any existing monitoring pages
- Emotional intelligence monitor fills a gap between personality profiling and performance analytics by tracking behavioral patterns and agent wellness indicators
