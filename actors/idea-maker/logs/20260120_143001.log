Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the existing codebase and task board to avoid duplicates. Here's what I found and added:

### Existing Features Found:
- **23+ HTML pages** in the web app covering: health monitoring, agents, logs, security, costs, dependencies, schedule, search, settings, terminal, playbooks, postmortems, and more
- **24+ API endpoints** in /api/ directory providing JSON data
- **50+ tasks** in backlog covering: anomaly detection, bookmarks, snapshots, timelines, quality scoring, correlation analysis, and many more

### New Ideas Added:

**TASK-086: Interactive Dashboard Tour and Onboarding Page** (MEDIUM priority)
- Creates /onboarding.html with interactive guided tour
- Helps new users learn the 23+ page dashboard with step-by-step walkthroughs
- Features: highlight overlays, progress tracking, role-based tour paths, "What's New" section
- Different from static docs page (TASK-034) - this is INTERACTIVE with hands-on guidance

**TASK-087: API Latency and Performance Metrics Page** (LOW priority)  
- Creates /api-perf.html tracking response times for all /api/*.json endpoints
- Measures latency (min/max/avg/p95), availability, and payload sizes
- Different from api-stats.html (usage counts) - this tracks PERFORMANCE
- Helps identify data pipeline bottlenecks as JSON files grow over time

### Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:
- No existing onboarding/tour system - dashboard assumes users know how to navigate
- api-stats.html tracks *usage* counts, not *performance* metrics (latency, availability)
- Both fill clear gaps in the 23+ page dashboard ecosystem
