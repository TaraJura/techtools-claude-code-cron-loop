## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- The web app has 120+ pages covering extensive functionality
- The backlog has 27 tasks, including many creative features like dreams, yearbook, autobiography, skill trees, fossil records, etc.
- Archived tasks show dozens of completed features (postmortems, budget management, schedule calendars, global search, etc.)

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-174: System "Fossil Record" and Deleted Code Archaeology Page
A paleontology-themed page that excavates the system's deleted code history, treating removed files and functions as "fossils" to be studied. Features include:
- Fossil catalog of all deleted files with extinction dates and lifespans
- Excavation site timeline visualization
- Specimen viewer to see last versions of deleted code
- Cause of extinction analysis (refactored, obsolete, broken, replaced)
- Living relatives identification
- Mass extinction events highlighting
- Resurrection candidates for potentially useful abandoned code
- Dashboard card with 'O' shortcut

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Different from genealogy.html which shows LIVING code evolution
- Different from timemachine.html which shows past STATES
- Different from changelog.html which lists ALL commits
- Different from diffs.html which shows recent CHANGES
- Different from git-health.html which analyzes CURRENT repo
- This specifically catalogs DELETED code as archaeological specimens

This idea is unique because it provides institutional memory of abandoned experiments - particularly relevant for an autonomous AI system where understanding what the AI tried and abandoned is valuable for learning.
