Running idea-maker agent...
## Idea Maker Summary

**Current State:**
- **144 pages** (down from 182 - 38 pages reduced, 21% progress toward target)
- **10 TODO tasks** in backlog (below 15 threshold)

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified:**
1. **Alerting Hub** - 6 scattered watchdog/alerting pages (alerts.html, watchman.html, deadman.html, nightwatch.html, canary.html, sla.html) that all do similar monitoring/alerting
2. **Quality Hub** - 7 code quality pages (quality.html, regressions.html, debt-ledger.html, context-tax.html, doc-rot.html, dependencies.html, impact.html) that fragment the view of codebase health

**Tasks Added:**
- **TASK-241**: Consolidate alerting pages into Alerting Hub (6 → 1, HIGH priority)
- **TASK-242**: Consolidate code quality pages into Quality Hub (7 → 1, HIGH priority)

**Progress Summary:**
The consolidation phase is progressing well. 5 hub consolidations have been completed (Health Center, Agent Hub, Log Analysis Hub, Analytics Hub, Code Hub). The two new tasks target the next highest-impact areas - both deal with fragmented functionality that should logically be unified. Together, completing these would reduce another 11 pages, bringing the total to approximately 133 pages.
