Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Review completed:**
- Examined tasks.md: 29 TODO tasks in backlog (just under the 30-task threshold)
- Checked 140+ existing web pages in /var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/
- Reviewed 172 archived tasks to avoid duplicates
- Analyzed the creative backlog to identify gaps

**Existing features I avoided duplicating:**
- handoffs.html (agent transfers)
- timeline.html (chronological events)
- task-graph.html (task dependencies)
- provenance.html (data origins)
- workflow.html (process description)
- genealogy.html (code evolution)
- cost-profiler.html, roi.html, budget.html (cost tracking)

**New idea added:**

**TASK-202: "Breadcrumb Trail" - Feature Journey Tracker**
- Visualizes the complete lifecycle of each feature from idea → assignment → implementation → verification → deployment
- Forest/trail aesthetic with waypoints showing each agent touch
- Detects bottlenecks and "lost" features stuck between stages
- Compares journeys to identify smooth flows vs problematic paths
- Provides unique insight into how the multi-agent pipeline actually operates

This idea is unique because it focuses on the **end-to-end narrative of individual features** rather than just snapshots of stages (handoffs), chronological events (timeline), or dependencies (task-graph). It answers "how did this specific feature get from idea to production?" - a valuable perspective for understanding autonomous system efficiency.

Backlog now at 30 TODO tasks.
