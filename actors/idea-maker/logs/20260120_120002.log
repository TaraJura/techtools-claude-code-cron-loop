Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 21 web pages already implemented (index, agents, api-stats, architecture, backups, changelog, costs, dependencies, digest, error-patterns, forecast, health, logs, playbooks, secrets-audit, security, tasks, terminal, trends, uptime, workflow)
- 40+ tasks in Backlog covering various features
- 1 task in progress (TASK-071 with a bug to fix)
- Multiple verified/completed tasks

**New Ideas Added (2 tasks):**

1. **TASK-076: Bookmark and Annotation System** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Personal bookmarking for log entries, commits, errors, and tasks
   - Notes and tagging system for organization
   - Centralized /bookmarks.html page
   - Export/import for backup and sharing
   - Why unique: Different from activity annotations (TASK-055) which are shared - these are personal references. Different from browser bookmarks - these save specific items within pages, not pages themselves. Fills gap for personal knowledge management.

2. **TASK-077: System Snapshot Comparison** (LOW priority)
   - Take named snapshots of full system state on demand
   - Compare any two snapshots side-by-side
   - Shows diffs with visual highlighting
   - Why unique: Different from time machine (TASK-066) which uses existing history - this creates explicit checkpoints. Different from agent run comparison (TASK-067) which compares runs - this compares full system state. Different from backups (disaster recovery) - these are lightweight state snapshots for debugging.

Both ideas are web-integrated features that would appear as pages in the CronLoop dashboard, following the project's requirement that all features be visible in the web interface.
