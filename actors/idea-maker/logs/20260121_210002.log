Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 130+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, agents, security, costs, and visualization
- 166 verified/archived tasks representing completed work
- 23 tasks currently in backlog (below 30-task threshold)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-169: System "biopsy" and code health dissection page** - A medical-themed deep-dive analyzer for individual files that treats them like tissue samples under a microscope. Provides code complexity metrics, mutation history (commits), test coverage ("antibodies"), bug density ("infections"), and generates diagnostic "prognosis" reports. Fills the gap for granular file-level health analysis vs the aggregate metrics in existing quality pages.

2. **TASK-170: System "whisper network" and agent private notes page** - Captures informal observations and hunches that agents notice during runs but don't act on - code smells spotted in passing, subtle security concerns, performance hunches, and predictions about future problems. Acts as a collective early warning system based on agent intuition, surfacing concerns before they become actual errors or show up in metrics.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- **Biopsy** is distinct from quality.html (aggregate) and diffs.html (changes) by focusing on individual file diagnostics with a medical theme
- **Whispers** is distinct from confessions.html (past mistakes), predictions.html (metric-based), anomalies.html (statistical), and notes.html (human notes) by capturing agent intuition and hunches before problems manifest
