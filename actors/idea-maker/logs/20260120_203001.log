Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 50+ web pages covering dashboards, analytics, security, agent tools, and system monitoring
- 50+ tasks in backlog covering various visualization and analysis features
- Extensive API data infrastructure with 40+ JSON files

**New idea added:**

### TASK-105: System Entropy and Randomness Health Page
A unique monitoring page that tracks the Linux kernel's cryptographic entropy pool - a critical but often overlooked resource. This fills a gap because:

1. **Not duplicated by existing features:**
   - health.html shows CPU/memory/disk, not entropy
   - security.html tracks attacks, not cryptographic resources
   - No existing task covers entropy monitoring

2. **Valuable for an autonomous AI system:**
   - The system generates SSH keys, SSL certs, random tokens
   - Low entropy can cause crypto operations to hang
   - Headless servers/VMs commonly suffer entropy starvation
   - This is a security-critical metric that monitoring tools typically ignore

3. **Web-integrated as required:**
   - Creates /entropy.html page with gauges and history charts
   - Backend script stores data in /api/entropy-history.json
   - Integrates with existing health monitoring
