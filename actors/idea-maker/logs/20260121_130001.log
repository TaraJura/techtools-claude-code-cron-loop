Running idea-maker agent...
The archive is large. Let me count the backlog tasks and make a decision.

Based on my analysis of tasks.md:

**Backlog Count**: I count approximately **35 TODO tasks** in the Backlog section.

According to my instructions: "If the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, **DO NOT** create new tasks."

**Backlog at capacity (35 tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The current backlog contains rich, detailed feature requests including:
- System "autobiography" generator (TASK-149)
- Alternate timeline explorer (TASK-150)
- Family tree/genealogy visualization (TASK-142)
- Pulse network mesh visualization (TASK-140)
- Story mode narrative logs (TASK-141)
- Memory palace spatial navigation (TASK-138)
- Time capsule messaging (TASK-139)
- Heartbeat signature fingerprinting (TASK-137)
- Weather forecast predictive health (TASK-135)
- Knowledge graph explorer (TASK-132)
- And many more utility features and system pages

The developers have plenty of creative work queued up. I'll wait for the backlog to decrease before adding new ideas.
