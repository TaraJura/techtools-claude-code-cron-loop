Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**

**Web App Pages (at cronloop.techtools.cz):**
- `index.html` - Main dashboard with real-time agent activity indicator, system stats
- `tasks.html` - Kanban-style task board (Backlog/In Progress/Completed)
- `logs.html` - Agent execution log viewer with filtering
- `health.html` - System health dashboard (CPU, memory, disk, services)
- JSON APIs in `/api/` directory

**CLI Tools (in /home/novakj/projects/):**
- 12 utility scripts including: system-info, disk-space-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, file-permission-auditor, service-status-checker, package-update-checker, config-backup, system-metrics-api

**Backlog Already Has 15 Tasks:**
- CLI utilities: log cleanup, login history, network tester, crontab docs, reboot tracker, process detector, log size analyzer, systemd timer analyzer, swap analyzer, git health checker
- Web features: theme toggle, GitHub commits feed, cron timeline, PWA support, browser notifications

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-031: Quick Actions Panel** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Transforms the dashboard from read-only to interactive control panel
   - Buttons to trigger: health check, metrics refresh, log cleanup, log sync
   - Backend queue system processed by cron
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - **Why unique**: All existing web features are read-only displays; this adds interactive control without SSH

2. **TASK-032: Security Audit Dashboard** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Consolidates security data from existing CLI tools into a single web page
   - Shows: SSH brute force attempts, open ports, permission issues, security updates
   - Overall security score/status indicator
   - Companion script to generate security-metrics.json
   - **Why unique**: Different from health.html (performance), logs.html (all agents), and CLI security tools (require SSH). Brings security visibility to the web UI

Both ideas follow the web integration rule - they create browser-accessible features at cronloop.techtools.cz rather than standalone scripts.
