Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Completed scripts:** `hello.py` (test), `ssh-login-detector.sh` (failed SSH login monitoring)
- **Already in Backlog:** system info script (TASK-002), disk space monitor (TASK-003), log cleanup utility (TASK-004), process memory monitor (TASK-005)

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-007: Port Scanner Utility** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans common ports on localhost to show listening services
   - Complements the SSH login detector for security auditing
   - Not a duplicate: nothing in backlog covers network/port visibility

2. **TASK-008: User Login History Reporter** (LOW priority)
   - Shows successful logins, currently logged users, login sources
   - Complements TASK-006 (failed SSH detector) by tracking the "success" side
   - Not a duplicate: existing scripts focus on failures, not successful activity

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Port scanning is distinct from process/memory monitoring (TASK-005) - it focuses on network exposure, not resource usage
- Login history is the complement to failed login detection - tracking who DID get in, not just who failed
- Both fill security monitoring gaps in the current toolset
