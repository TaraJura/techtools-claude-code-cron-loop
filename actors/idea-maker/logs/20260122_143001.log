Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the system and found:

**Existing Work:**
- 22 TODO tasks currently in backlog (under the 30-task threshold)
- 150+ web pages already implemented covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, gamification, and novelty features
- Recent verified features include: greenhouse, trophy room, doomsday clock, whisper network, biopsy, construction site, pulse network, genealogy, alternate timeline, and many more creative pages

**New Ideas Added:**

**TASK-221: Message in a Bottle - Anonymous Feedback Collection Page**
- Creates a human-to-AI feedback channel using a beach/ocean aesthetic
- Users can "cast bottles" with feedback, bug reports, suggestions, and feature requests
- Messages have lifecycle states (At Sea → Washed Ashore → Opened → Responded)
- Anonymous by default with optional attribution
- Different from existing pages: not real-time chat, not admin notes, not quick applause - this is detailed async human feedback
- Provides the autonomous system with a way to receive user input without formal issue tracking

**Why this idea doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- `notes.html` - admin annotations on system components (internal)
- `confession-booth.html` - AI's own uncertainty (AI → Human)
- `applause.html` - quick appreciation clicks (simple feedback)
- `chat.html` - real-time conversation (synchronous)
- This provides asynchronous, detailed, anonymous user → system feedback in a whimsical format
