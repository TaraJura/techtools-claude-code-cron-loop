Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 8 completed scripts in `/home/novakj/projects/`: system-info, disk-space-monitor, memory-monitor, ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, service-status-checker, file-permission-auditor, hello.py
- 8 pending tasks in backlog: log cleanup, user login history, network tester, crontab docs, reboot tracker, package updates, long-running process detector, log file analyzer

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-017: Systemd Timer Analyzer** (Priority: LOW)
   - Lists all systemd timers with schedules and run times
   - Complements TASK-011 (crontab docs) - cron only covers traditional cron, not systemd timers
   - Modern Ubuntu uses systemd timers extensively, so this fills a visibility gap

2. **TASK-018: Swap Usage Analyzer** (Priority: LOW)
   - Monitors swap usage and identifies which processes use swap
   - Different from memory-monitor.sh which focuses on RAM/RSS usage
   - Swap analysis helps diagnose performance issues from memory pressure

**Why These Don't Duplicate:**
- TASK-017 is distinct from TASK-011 (crontab docs) because systemd timers are a completely different scheduling mechanism than cron
- TASK-018 is distinct from memory-monitor.sh because swap and RAM are different resources - a system can have low RAM usage but high swap usage from past memory pressure
