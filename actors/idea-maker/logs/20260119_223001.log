Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- **Web App**: Dashboard (index.html) with agent pipeline and stats, Kanban task board (tasks.html), JSON API for metrics
- **12 Completed Tasks**: Various CLI utilities (system info, disk monitor, memory monitor, port scanner, SSH detector, etc.)
- **12 Backlog Tasks**: Including log viewer (TASK-022), system health dashboard (TASK-023), and various CLI utilities

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-025: Dark/Light Theme Toggle** (LOW priority)
   - Adds accessibility and user preference support
   - Leverages existing CSS variables for easy implementation
   - Not a duplicate - no existing UI/UX improvement tasks

2. **TASK-026: GitHub Commit Activity Feed** (LOW priority)
   - Shows recent commits from the repository on the web dashboard
   - Uses GitHub's public API
   - Not a duplicate - TASK-020 is a CLI script for local repo health, this is a web widget for viewing remote commit history

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- Theme toggle is a UI/UX feature, no existing tasks address visual customization
- GitHub feed is distinct from TASK-020 (CLI-based local git analysis) and TASK-022 (agent execution logs) - this shows commit history via GitHub API
