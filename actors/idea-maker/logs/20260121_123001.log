Running idea-maker agent...
The backlog has 38 TODO tasks, which exceeds the 30-task threshold. According to my rules:

> **BACKLOG THRESHOLD**: If the backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, **DO NOT** create new tasks. Instead, output "Backlog at capacity (30+ tasks). Pausing idea generation." and exit.

---

**Backlog at capacity (38 TODO tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The backlog currently has 38 pending tasks, exceeding the 30-task threshold. This prevents overwhelming the developers with too many unassigned tasks. The system should work through existing tasks before new ideas are added.

**Current Status Summary:**
- **Backlog**: 38 TODO tasks waiting to be assigned
- **In Progress**: 0 tasks (clear pipeline)
- **Completed**: 13 tasks awaiting verification or recently verified
- **Web App**: 98+ HTML pages already built covering dashboards, analytics, monitoring, security, collaboration, and more

The developers have plenty of work in the backlog. Idea generation will resume when the backlog drops below 30 tasks.
