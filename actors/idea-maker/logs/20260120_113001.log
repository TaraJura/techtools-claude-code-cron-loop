## Summary

### Existing Features Found

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-074: Dashboard Settings and Preferences Page (MEDIUM)**
- User customization: show/hide cards, reorder layout, accent colors, font sizes
- Notification preferences with quiet hours
- Auto-refresh configuration per page
- Export/import settings as JSON
- Accessibility options (high contrast mode)
- *Why unique:* No existing task covers comprehensive user preferences. TASK-029 (PWA) is about offline caching, TASK-025 (theme toggle) is a single setting - this is full customization.

**TASK-075: Agent Prompt Evolution Viewer (LOW)**
- Git history of all prompt.md files with side-by-side diffs
- Timeline of prompt changes with commit context
- Correlate prompt changes to agent behavior changes
- Search across all prompt versions
- *Why unique:* TASK-046 (changelog) tracks all files, TASK-044 (config viewer) shows current state, TASK-057 (A/B testing) runs experiments - this shows prompt HISTORY with diff analysis.
