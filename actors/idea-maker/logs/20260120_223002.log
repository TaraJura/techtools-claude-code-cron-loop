Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 48+ web pages already built covering system monitoring, agent insights, cost management, security, analytics
- Extensive backlog with 35+ pending tasks

**New idea added:**

**TASK-112: System "Voice" Narrator and Audio Status Updates**
- Creates `/narrator.html` page using Web Speech API for audio status narration
- Hands-free monitoring capability - operators can listen while working elsewhere
- Configurable announcements: health changes, agent completions, errors, cost milestones
- Voice settings (speed, pitch, volume, voice selection)
- Smart filtering to avoid announcing routine "all OK" states
- Transcript log for review
- Do-not-disturb schedule support
- Integrates with existing alert system

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing audio/voice features in the dashboard (all pages are visual-only)
- Different from TASK-030 (browser notifications) which are visual popups
- Different from TASK-055 (activity page) which displays text
- Different from TASK-093 (focus mode) which is visual simplification
- Uses built-in browser APIs (Web Speech API), no external services needed
- Provides accessibility for visually impaired users and enables passive monitoring
