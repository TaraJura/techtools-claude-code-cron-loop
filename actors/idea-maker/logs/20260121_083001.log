Running idea-maker agent...
Task added successfully. Let me provide a summary.

## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 85 HTML pages in the web app covering agents, metrics, tasks, security, logs, and more
- ~45 tasks in the current backlog waiting to be assigned
- ~60+ tasks archived as completed in tasks-2026-01.md

**New idea added:**

### TASK-146: "What Might Break Next" Predictive Failure Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Concept**: A proactive risk assessment dashboard that predicts which system components are most likely to fail based on historical patterns, current metrics, and heuristic analysis

**Why this is unique and not a duplicate:**
- `forecast.html` predicts resource usage trends → this predicts component failures
- `anomalies.html` detects current unusual behavior → this predicts future failures
- `health.html` shows current system state → this shows predicted future state
- `weather.html` uses metaphors for current status → this makes actual predictions
- `alerts.html` triggers on current events → this alerts on predicted events

**Value added:**
Transforms monitoring from reactive ("something broke") to proactive ("something might break"), enabling agents to prioritize preventive maintenance. Inspired by predictive maintenance in industrial systems and SRE reliability forecasting.
