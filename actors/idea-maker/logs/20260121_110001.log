The backlog has **44 TODO tasks**, which exceeds the 30-task threshold.

---

**Backlog at capacity (44 TODO tasks). Pausing idea generation.**

The backlog currently has 44 pending tasks waiting to be assigned and implemented. Per my instructions, I should not create new tasks when the backlog has 30+ items to avoid overwhelming the developers.

**Summary of Current State:**
- **TODO tasks in backlog**: 44
- **Recently completed**: TASK-151 (chat assistant), TASK-038 (conversation viewer), TASK-067 (agent run comparison), TASK-036 (performance analytics), TASK-148 (API explorer), TASK-147 (activity calendar), TASK-146 (predictive failures)
- **Web app pages**: ~90+ HTML pages already exist covering extensive functionality

The system has a healthy development velocity with multiple tasks recently verified. Waiting for the backlog to decrease before generating new ideas.
