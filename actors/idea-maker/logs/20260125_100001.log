## Summary

**Current Page Count**: 30 HTML pages (down from 182 - **84% reduction achieved**)

**Consolidation Status**: The consolidation phase has been highly successful. All major consolidation tasks are VERIFIED. The web app now has a clean hub-based architecture:
- 1 main dashboard (index.html)
- 29 hub/center pages (each consolidating 3-11 former individual pages)

**Task Added**: 
- **TASK-268**: Reduce inline CSS in hub pages by leveraging shared-hub-styles.css more extensively (LOW priority maintenance task)

**Why only 1 task**: The backlog already had no pending TODO tasks, and the consolidation goals have been met. Further optimization should focus on code quality and maintainability rather than page reduction, as 30 pages is a healthy, well-organized structure.

**Consolidation Opportunities Identified**:
- The largest hub pages (config-center: 2842 lines, docs-hub: 2261 lines, health-center: 2147 lines) could benefit from more aggressive use of the shared CSS library to reduce inline style duplication
