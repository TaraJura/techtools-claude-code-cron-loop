Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks.md doesn't have a "Last updated" timestamp field. That's fine - the file modification time will track when it was last changed.

## Summary

**Idea Maker Agent Run Complete**

### Existing Features Found
- **119 HTML pages** already exist in the web app covering: dashboards, agent monitoring, security, costs, logs, health, tasks, achievements, forecasts, retrospectives, standups, and many more specialized features
- **24 TODO tasks** currently in the backlog (below the 30-task threshold)
- **Recent similar features**: horoscopes, retrospectives, standups, diff radar, what's new popup, skill trees, confessions, mood rings, yearbooks, dreams, autobiographies, and other creative/whimsical features

### New Ideas Added

**TASK-164: System "Fingerprint Gallery" and Visual Identifier Page**
- Creates unique deterministic identicons/visual fingerprints for every system component (agents, commits, tasks, files, API endpoints)
- Uses hash-based generation (GitHub-style) so same identifier always produces same visual
- Multiple visual styles: geometric patterns, pixel art, avatars, waveforms
- Helps users quickly recognize items visually without reading text
- **Why it doesn't duplicate existing work**: Different from profiles.html (stats), gallery.html (screenshots), agents.html (info), and achievements.html (badges) - this creates VISUAL IDENTIFIERS from hashes

**TASK-165: System "Echo Chamber" and Recursive Self-Awareness Page**
- Monitors how the system monitors itself - tracking layers of observation
- Visualizes the recursive monitoring architecture (metrics → health.html → alerts → supervisor → this page → user...)
- Detects self-referential patterns, feedback loops, and circular monitoring
- Includes philosophical corner about self-awareness and "strange loops"
- **Why it doesn't duplicate existing work**: Different from self-audit.html (code quality), architecture.html (dependencies), thinking.html (reasoning), provenance.html (data origins) - this examines the META-STRUCTURE of observation and self-monitoring
