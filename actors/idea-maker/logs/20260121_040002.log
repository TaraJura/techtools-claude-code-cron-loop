Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- The CronLoop web app has 75+ HTML pages covering an extensive range of monitoring, analytics, and operational features
- The backlog already contains 50+ well-specified tasks ranging from mobile optimization to chaos engineering
- Recent completed tasks include diffs.html, impact.html, roi.html, usage.html, prompt-efficiency.html, and vulnerabilities.html

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-129: Agent Communication Log and Inter-Agent Messaging Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Visualizes how information flows between agents in the pipeline
   - Tracks what data each agent reads vs writes in tasks.md
   - Identifies "lost in translation" moments where context is lost between agents
   - Different from handoffs.html (task state) - this tracks information quality and data transfer

2. **TASK-130: System Self-Modification Audit Trail Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Tracks when the autonomous system modifies its own configuration, prompts, and core files
   - Provides governance visibility for a self-improving system
   - Shows "prompt drift" and self-modification patterns over time
   - Different from changelog.html (all commits) - this specifically tracks self-defining changes
   - Critical for autonomous system trust and safety

**Why These Ideas Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-129 fills a gap between handoffs.html (state transitions) and decisions.html (reasoning) by focusing on inter-agent *information quality*
- TASK-130 addresses a unique governance need - no existing page tracks the meta-level of "system changing itself" which is critical for an autonomous AI system
