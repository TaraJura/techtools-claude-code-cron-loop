Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**What I reviewed:**
- `tasks.md` - All 60+ active backlog tasks, in-progress items, and recently completed tasks
- Task archive (`tasks-2026-01.md`) - 80+ historically completed tasks to avoid duplicates
- Web app directory (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`) - 75+ existing HTML pages

**Existing features found:**
- Comprehensive monitoring pages: health, memory, network, CPU, uptime
- Agent analytics: leaderboard, profiles, learning, handoffs, collaboration
- Cost tracking: costs, budget, cost-profiler
- Security: vulnerabilities, security, secrets-audit
- Visualization: weather, gallery, architecture, timeline, task-graph
- Many more specialized pages

**New idea added:**

### TASK-124: Dead Feature and Unused Page Detector
Creates `/usage.html` to track which web app features are actually being used vs abandoned by analyzing nginx access logs. This helps identify:
- Ghost pages with near-zero visits
- Orphan API endpoints no page fetches
- Features that cost tokens to build but provide no value
- Cleanup candidates safe to remove

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from `api-stats.html` (tracks API patterns, not page visits)
- Different from `freshness.html` (monitors data staleness, not user engagement)
- Different from `retention.html` (tracks data storage, not feature adoption)
- The system builds many features autonomously - this ensures they're actually useful
