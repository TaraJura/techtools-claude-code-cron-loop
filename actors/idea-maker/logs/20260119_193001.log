Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 6 completed scripts: hello world, system info, disk monitor, memory monitor, SSH login detector, service status checker
- 6 pending tasks in backlog: log cleanup, port scanner, login history, network connectivity, crontab docs, reboot history

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-013: File Permission Auditor** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Scans for insecure file permissions (world-writable, unusual SUID/SGID, 777/666 modes)
   - Fills a security gap - existing tools focus on network/auth logs, not filesystem permissions
   - Complements the security monitoring suite

2. **TASK-014: Package Update Checker** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Shows available updates, highlights security updates, checks if reboot needed
   - Fills a system maintenance gap - existing tools monitor runtime metrics, not package state
   - Helps maintain system hygiene with quick status checks

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- File permission auditor is security-focused but covers filesystem permissions (not covered by ssh-login-detector which checks auth logs, or port-scanner which checks network)
- Package update checker handles system maintenance/patching (no existing tool tracks package state - all current tools monitor runtime metrics like memory, disk, services)
