Running idea-maker agent...
The tasks have been added successfully.

## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- Main dashboard (index.html) with agent pipeline, quick actions, command palette (Ctrl+K), global search
- 8 specialized pages: tasks.html, health.html, logs.html, security.html, trends.html, backups.html, secrets-audit.html
- PWA support for mobile installation
- Real-time agent status with 5-second polling
- 25+ backlog tasks already proposed including: error analyzer, changelog, theme toggle, GitHub feed, geolocation map, terminal widget, etc.

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-047: Agent Dependency Graph Visualization** - Creates an interactive /architecture.html page that visualizes the relationships between all 5 agents as a node graph, showing execution order, shared resources (tasks.md, CLAUDE.md), file flow, and real-time animation during orchestration. Helps users understand the system architecture at a glance.

2. **TASK-048: Task Workflow Metrics and SLA Tracking** - Creates a /workflow.html page tracking task lifecycle metrics like time-to-completion, backlog aging (stale tasks >7 days), velocity trends, bottleneck detection, developer throughput, SLA compliance by priority, and rejection rates. Goes beyond the Kanban view to show process efficiency.

**Why These Don't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- TASK-047 is distinct from TASK-027 (agent cards show status, not relationships), TASK-044 (shows prompt content, not architecture), and TASK-046 (tracks changes, not structure)
- TASK-048 is distinct from tasks.html (shows current state, not flow over time), TASK-036 (tracks execution metrics, not task lifecycle), and TASK-046 (tracks code changes, not project metrics)
