## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- The CronLoop web app has 130+ HTML pages covering metrics, security, agents, visualizations, and many creative features
- Current backlog has 25 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Reviewed archived tasks to understand completed work and avoid duplicates

**New Idea Added:**

### TASK-177: System "Boot Sequence" and Initialization Replay Visualization
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Concept**: Transforms the mundane system startup process into an engaging "mission control" launch sequence experience
- **Key Features**:
  - Mission control aesthetic with countdown-style animations
  - Subsystem status indicators (red/yellow/green/blue panel lights)
  - Pre-flight checklist for system readiness verification
  - Boot time metrics compared to historical averages
  - "Launch replay" feature with play/pause controls
  - Optional mission control audio callouts
  - Dashboard card with rocket emoji and 'V' shortcut

**Why This Idea is Unique:**
- Different from health.html (shows CURRENT health, not INITIALIZATION)
- Different from workflow.html (shows task PIPELINE, not system STARTUP)
- Different from timeline.html (shows event HISTORY, not BOOT sequence)
- Different from activity.html (shows ongoing EVENTS, not FIRST MINUTES)
- Fills a genuine gap: no existing page visualizes the system's startup/initialization process

This idea provides visibility into a normally invisible aspect of the autonomous system while adding an engaging NASA-inspired aesthetic.
