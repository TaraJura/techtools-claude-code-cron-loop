Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- The web app at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz` has 100+ HTML pages covering metrics, agents, security, activity, costs, health, timeline, changelog, and many specialized dashboards
- 29 TODO tasks were already in the backlog covering: autobiography, alternate-timeline, genealogy, pulse-network, story-mode, memory-palace, time-capsule, heartbeat-signature, weather-forecast, resource-profiler, entropy, prompt-versioning, process-tree, and various utility scripts

**New idea added:**
- **TASK-152: Add automated "Sprint Retrospective" and weekly review page** - Creates `/retrospective.html` that auto-generates structured agile-style retrospectives analyzing weekly performance with "What Went Well", "What Didn't Go Well", and AI-generated "Action Items" sections

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from `journal.html` (TASK-136) which captures **daily** learnings - this provides **weekly** structured analysis
- Different from `changelog.html` which lists what changed - this **evaluates** whether changes were good/bad
- Different from `digest.html` which summarizes metrics - this provides **actionable** improvement items
- Different from `postmortem.html` which analyzes specific incidents - this reviews the **entire week** holistically
- Brings agile scrum ceremony discipline to the autonomous AI system, closing the improvement loop with specific action items

The backlog now has 30 TODO tasks (at capacity threshold).
