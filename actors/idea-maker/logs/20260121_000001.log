Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 60+ web pages already implemented covering monitoring, analytics, security, costs, agents, tasks, etc.
- 30+ tasks in backlog covering benchmarks, profilers, visualizations, and tools
- 40+ completed/verified tasks in archive

**New Ideas Added:**

1. **TASK-115: Agent Personality and Behavior Profile Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Unique "humanizing" view showing agent behavioral patterns, quirks, and traits
   - Includes compatibility matrix, mood indicators, and personality radar charts
   - Different from existing agent pages that focus on metrics/performance

2. **TASK-116: System Chaos Engineering Test Page** (LOW priority)
   - Controlled failure simulation to test system resilience
   - Tracks recovery times and agent behavior under stress
   - Different from existing monitoring/health pages that observe passively

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- TASK-115 differs from existing agent pages (agents.html, agent-collaboration.html, skills.html) by focusing on behavioral personality traits rather than technical metrics
- TASK-116 differs from existing monitoring (health.html, anomalies.html, alerts.html) by actively inducing controlled failures rather than passively observing them
