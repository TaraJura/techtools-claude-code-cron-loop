Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 160+ web pages covering monitoring, metrics, agent management, visualization, analysis, cost tracking, security, and creative/fun features
- 21 tasks already in backlog (below 30 threshold)
- Checked archived tasks for historical duplicates

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-217: "Doomsday Clock" - Catastrophic Risk Countdown Page** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Aggregates all system risk factors into a single iconic visualization
   - Shows "minutes to midnight" based on combined threats (disk, errors, security, budget, uptime)
   - Different from existing pages: health.html shows current status, this projects EXISTENTIAL risk
   - Inspired by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' famous clock

2. **TASK-218: "Trophy Room" - Milestone Museum Gallery Page** (LOW priority)
   - Interactive museum showcasing system achievements as physical trophies
   - Includes "Hall of Firsts", "Records Wing", "Legends Wing" with 3D trophy viewers
   - Different from achievements.html which lists achievements - this presents them as MUSEUM exhibits
   - Inspired by video game trophy rooms and sports halls of fame

**Why these don't duplicate existing work:**
- No existing page aggregates risk into a single "catastrophe countdown" metric
- While achievements.html exists, the trophy room takes a fundamentally different approach with museum aesthetics, 3D viewers, and exhibit-style presentation
