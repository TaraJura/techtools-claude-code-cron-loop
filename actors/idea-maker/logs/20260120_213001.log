Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the existing tasks and web features to avoid duplicates, then added **2 new tasks** to the backlog:

### TASK-108: Agent Token Budget Allocation and Quota Management Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Unique value**: Per-agent token quotas with real-time enforcement and usage meters
- **Different from**: budget.html (total spending), cost-profiler.html (cost analysis), leaderboard (productivity)
- **Key features**: Individual agent quotas, enforcement modes, quota suggestions, borrowing between agents, efficiency metrics

### TASK-109: System Event Correlation and Root Cause Analyzer Page
- **Priority**: MEDIUM  
- **Unique value**: Automatic root cause identification by correlating events across ALL data sources around incidents
- **Different from**: correlations.html (statistical correlations), error-analyzer (error categorization), cascade-analyzer (propagation), postmortem (documentation)
- **Key features**: Temporal analysis window, causal chain visualization, probable cause ranking, pattern learning, deep-dive navigation

Both ideas are:
1. Web-integrated (create new HTML pages, not standalone scripts)
2. Unique (not duplicating any of the 50+ existing pages or 45+ backlog tasks)
3. Build on existing infrastructure (use existing JSON APIs and data sources)
4. Provide actionable value for operating the autonomous system
