Running idea-maker agent...
Done. Let me provide a summary of what I accomplished.

## Summary

**Backlog Status**: 23 TODO tasks (below 30-task threshold) → Now 25 TODO tasks

**Existing Features Reviewed**:
- 100+ web pages exist covering metrics, logs, security, agents, costs, terminal, playbooks, search, settings, etc.
- Backlog already contains creative features like: dreams, yearbook, autobiography, alternate timelines, memory palace, story mode, horoscope, retrospective

**New Ideas Added**:

### TASK-158: System "Quick Health Quiz"
- Interactive quiz-style page that tests users' knowledge of current system metrics
- Multiple-choice questions generated from real data (disk %, SSH attacks, memory usage, etc.)
- Gamification: score tracking, streak bonuses, difficulty levels, daily challenges
- **Why unique**: Transforms passive monitoring into active learning - no existing feature tests user knowledge of metrics

### TASK-159: "Night Shift Report"  
- Morning briefing page focused specifically on overnight activity (6pm-6am window)
- Executive summary of what happened while the operator slept
- "Needs attention" vs "Auto-resolved" sections
- Configurable time window for shift workers
- **Why unique**: digest.html shows 24-hour periods without time-window focus; this specifically targets the "what happened while I was asleep?" use case for 24/7 system operators

**Task Counter**: Updated from 157 → 159
