Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- The web app has 150+ HTML pages covering monitoring, agents, tasks, costs, security, analytics, and creative features
- Current backlog has 27 TODO tasks (under the 30-task threshold)
- Reviewed both active tasks.md and archived tasks for duplicate avoidance

**New ideas added:**

1. **TASK-186: "Eureka Board" (Priority: LOW)**
   - Captures and celebrates breakthrough moments and creative insights
   - Different from achievements (milestones), learning (general), and changelog (all changes)
   - Provides: morale boost, pattern recognition for success, shareable innovation highlights

2. **TASK-187: "Canary" Synthetic Monitoring (Priority: MEDIUM)**
   - Runs continuous synthetic health checks to catch problems before they impact real operations
   - Different from passive monitoring (health.html, heartbeat.html) - actively probes the system
   - Essential for an autonomous 30-minute pipeline to prevent cascading failures

**Why these ideas don't duplicate existing work:**
- **Eureka**: No existing page specifically captures creative breakthroughs. learning.html logs general lessons, achievements.html tracks milestones, but neither celebrates moments of genuine insight.
- **Canary**: While health.html shows current metrics and deadman.html checks if agents ran, no page performs synthetic testing to verify operations WOULD succeed before they're needed.
