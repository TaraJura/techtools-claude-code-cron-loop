Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Found:**
- 160+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, visualization, storytelling, and gamification
- 19 TODO tasks already in the backlog (well under the 30-task threshold)
- Recent verified tasks include morning-brief.html, bus-factor.html, fossils.html, and messages.html

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-224: System "Nerve Center" - Real-time Biometric Vital Signs Display**
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (elevated because this provides intuitive health monitoring)
- **Concept**: Display server metrics as medical biometrics in an ICU-style interface
  - CPU → Heart rate with EKG waveform
  - Memory → Blood pressure (used/cached as systolic/diastolic)
  - Disk I/O → Respiratory rate 
  - Network → Neural activity brainwaves
  - Temperature → Body temperature with fever zones

**Why This Doesn't Duplicate Existing Work:**
- `health.html` shows simple health status text/icons - this creates visual EKG waveforms
- `pulse.html` shows a single heartbeat animation - this is a full vital signs suite
- `metrics.html` pages show raw numbers - this translates into human-intuitive biometrics
- `weather.html` uses weather metaphors - this uses medical metaphors

**Unique Value:** Leverages human intuition about body vital signs ("heart rate is elevated") instead of requiring technical understanding ("CPU at 78%"). Makes server monitoring feel like caring for a patient.

I created 1 new MEDIUM priority task. The backlog now has 20 TODO tasks.
