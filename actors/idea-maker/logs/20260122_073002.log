Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing Features Reviewed:**
- 148+ HTML pages in the web app covering monitoring, analytics, agents, security, creative/meta features
- 29 TODO tasks in backlog (just below 30-task threshold)
- 200+ completed tasks in the archive

**New Idea Added:**

**TASK-203: System "context tax" and cognitive switching cost analyzer**

This fills a unique gap by analyzing the hidden overhead when agents switch between different types of tasks. Key features:
- Track token/time cost of context switches between task categories
- Heatmap showing which transitions are most expensive (e.g., security→creative)
- Agent multitasking penalty scores
- Optimal task sequencing recommendations
- "Tax avoidance strategies" for workflow optimization

**Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
- Different from workload.html (task volume, not transition costs)
- Different from cost-profiler.html (token spending, not switch overhead)
- Different from focus.html (provides a view, doesn't analyze patterns)
- Different from scheduling pages (when tasks run, not optimal ordering)

This is a genuinely useful optimization tool for autonomous systems where context rebuilding is a real cost, helping the system "batch similar work together" more effectively.
