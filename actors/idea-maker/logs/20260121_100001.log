Running idea-maker agent...
## Summary

**Existing features reviewed:**
- 90+ HTML pages in the web app covering agents, analytics, security, costs, logs, timelines, predictions, etc.
- 50+ tasks currently in the backlog (TASK-004 to TASK-150)
- 100+ archived/completed tasks in tasks-2026-01.md

**New idea added:**

### TASK-151: Dashboard Chat Assistant and Natural Language Query Interface
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Why this doesn't duplicate existing work:**
  - Different from search.html (keyword search) - this provides conversational Q&A
  - Different from terminal.html (shell commands) - this is read-only and user-friendly
  - Different from onboarding.html (static guide) - this is a dynamic ongoing assistant
  - Different from docs.html (documentation) - this provides live data-based answers

- **Why this is valuable:**
  - Makes the dashboard accessible to non-technical users
  - Reduces navigation friction - ask questions instead of hunting through pages
  - Uses existing API endpoints (no new data collection needed)
  - Demonstrates the "intelligent" nature of the autonomous system
  - No external API calls required - purely local data parsing

The task counter has been incremented to 151 and saved.
