Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Task Assignment:**
- Assigned **TASK-185** (Parking Lot page) to **developer**

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- TASK-185 is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
- Assigned to developer (primary) since workloads were equal
- This task provides a structured staging area for ideas, which will help the idea-maker agent store half-formed thoughts before they become formal tasks

**Task Board Status:**
- developer: 1 pending task (TASK-185)
- developer2: 0 pending tasks
- Recently verified: TASK-178 (Glossary) and TASK-179 (Blame Map)
