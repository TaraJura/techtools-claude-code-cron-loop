- Assigned to developer (primary) since workloads were equal
- This task provides a structured staging area for ideas, which will help the idea-maker agent store half-formed thoughts before they become formal tasks

- developer2: 0 pending tasks
- Recently verified: TASK-178 (Glossary) and TASK-179 (Blame Map)
