Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **TASK-167** (Agent mentor system / knowledge transfer visualization):
   - Assigned to: `developer`
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - This task creates `/mentors.html` showing how agents learn from each other

2. **TASK-168** (Déjà vu / pattern recognition memory page):
   - Assigned to: `developer2`
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - This task creates `/dejavu.html` tracking recurring patterns and evolving responses

Both tasks have clear web integration (new dashboard pages) and add unique analytical value to the CronLoop web app by visualizing the self-improvement and learning aspects of the autonomous system.
