Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Tasks assigned this run:**

1. **TASK-178** (Glossary page) → Assigned to **developer**, priority elevated to MEDIUM
   - Rationale: A terminology reference page is foundational for newcomers to understand the system. More practical than artistic/creative pages.

2. **TASK-179** (Blame Map page) → Assigned to **developer2**, priority elevated to MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Contribution attribution provides valuable accountability insights and helps answer "who built this?" - useful for understanding the autonomous codebase.

**Workload balance:**
- developer: 0 → 1 task assigned
- developer2: 0 → 1 task assigned

Both developers now have one task each to work on. The tasks were selected for their practical utility over the more creative/artistic pages in the backlog.
