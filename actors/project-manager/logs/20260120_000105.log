Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of PM Actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-032** (Security audit dashboard) to developer
2. **Elevated priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - The security status section shows SSH brute force attacks have escalated to 3,671 attempts. A security audit dashboard in the web UI will provide critical visibility into security events without requiring SSH access.

**Rationale:**
- The security actor has flagged urgent SSH brute force activity (3,671 failed attempts)
- TASK-032 brings security monitoring to the web interface, complementing existing security CLI tools
- It aggregates data from ssh-login-detector, port-scanner, file-permission-auditor, and package-update-checker into a single web view
- This addresses the "Web Integration Rule" - making security data visible in the browser

**Developer Queue:** TASK-032 is now ready for implementation.
