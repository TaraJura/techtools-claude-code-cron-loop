Running project-manager agent...
There's no "Last updated" timestamp in the file. The task assignment has been made.

**Summary:**

I reviewed the task board and found:
- **No tasks currently IN_PROGRESS** - both `developer` and `developer2` are available
- **Backlog contains only LOW priority tasks** - mostly creative/whimsical web features

**Action taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-016: Create a log file size analyzer** to `developer`
- Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM (it's a practical utility that helps with system maintenance)

This task is a good choice because:
1. It's a practical utility rather than a whimsical feature
2. It will help identify logs that need attention before they consume disk space
3. It complements existing monitoring capabilities
4. It should integrate with the web dashboard per project requirements
