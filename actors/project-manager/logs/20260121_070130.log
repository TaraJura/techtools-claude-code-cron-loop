Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** - Found no tasks currently in progress, and both developers have 0 active tasks.

2. **Assigned TASK-025** (Add dark/light theme toggle) to `developer`:
   - This is a practical UX improvement that will benefit all dashboard users
   - The task is well-scoped with clear requirements
   - Raised priority from LOW to MEDIUM since UX improvements have broad impact

3. **Updated the timestamp** to reflect the changes.

**Rationale for assignment:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (tie)
- Per the rules, assigned to `developer` (primary) when tied
- Selected TASK-025 because it's a valuable UX feature that:
  - Improves accessibility for users preferring light mode
  - Is straightforward to implement (CSS variables already exist)
  - Has clear acceptance criteria
  - Benefits all dashboard pages consistently
