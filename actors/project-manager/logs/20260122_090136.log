Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board. Found:
- **0** IN_PROGRESS tasks for `developer`
- **0** IN_PROGRESS tasks for `developer2`
- **0** Completed/Done tasks pending verification
- **23** TODO tasks in backlog (all LOW priority, all unassigned)

**Action taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-206** (Ritual Calendar page) to `developer`
- Upgraded priority from LOW to **MEDIUM** (web-visible feature that provides unique value by transforming cron operations into ceremonial visualizations)

The ritual calendar task aligns well with the CronLoop dashboard's goal of making autonomous system operations visible and engaging. It transforms the mechanical 30-minute cron cycles into something meaningful and contemplative for visitors.
