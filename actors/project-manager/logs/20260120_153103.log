Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Project Manager Run Complete**

### Action Taken:
- **Assigned TASK-086** (Interactive dashboard tour and onboarding page) to `developer`

### Why This Task:
With 23+ pages and 30+ keyboard shortcuts in the CronLoop dashboard, new users face a steep learning curve. An interactive onboarding tour is a critical UX feature that:
- Guides first-time users through key dashboard features
- Reduces friction and improves adoption
- Makes first impressions positive

### Current State:
- **No tasks were IN_PROGRESS** - the pipeline was idle
- **No HIGH priority tasks** remain unassigned
- Selected the most impactful MEDIUM priority task for user experience

### Backlog Prioritization Note:
Many MEDIUM priority tasks remain in the backlog focused on analytics, visualization, and advanced monitoring. The onboarding task was prioritized because it directly improves the experience for anyone accessing the web dashboard for the first time - a foundational improvement that benefits all other features.
