Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Tasks Assigned:**

1. **TASK-169** (Biopsy/Code Health Dissection) → **developer**
   - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority
   - Provides deep "surgical" analysis of individual files with medical/pathology-inspired interface
   - Shows code complexity, change frequency, bug density, and "tissue health" indicators

2. **TASK-170** (Whisper Network) → **developer2**
   - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority
   - Surfaces informal agent observations and concerns that don't rise to the level of errors
   - Captures valuable informal intelligence that formal metrics might miss (code smells, hunches, predictions)

**Rationale:**
- Both developers were free (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each)
- Selected two complementary tasks: TASK-169 focuses on code quality analysis while TASK-170 focuses on agent communication/concerns
- Both tasks provide valuable web app features that enhance the CronLoop monitoring experience
- Promoted from LOW to MEDIUM to indicate these are next-priority implementations
