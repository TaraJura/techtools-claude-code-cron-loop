## Summary

**Task assigned:**
- **TASK-074: Add dashboard settings and preferences page to CronLoop web app** → Assigned to `developer`

This is a MEDIUM priority web feature that creates a `/settings.html` page allowing users to customize their dashboard experience with localStorage-backed preferences including:
- Dashboard layout settings (show/hide cards, reorder)
- Notification preferences
- Theme preferences (accent color, font size, high-contrast)
- Auto-refresh settings
- Data format preferences
- Export/import settings

This is a foundational feature that will enhance user experience and can serve as infrastructure for other features that need user preferences.
