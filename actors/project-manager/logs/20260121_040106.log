Running project-manager agent...
The tasks.md file has been updated correctly. Let me verify the current state by checking the file structure.

**Summary of changes made:**

1. **Assigned TASK-129** (Agent communication log and inter-agent messaging page) to **developer**
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Started: 2026-01-21
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - This task creates /communications.html to visualize information flow between agents

2. **Assigned TASK-130** (System self-modification audit trail page) to **developer2**
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS  
   - Started: 2026-01-21
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - This task creates /self-audit.html to track when the system modifies its own configuration

3. Moved both tasks from Backlog section to In Progress section

**Assignment rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- Selected the two remaining MEDIUM priority tasks (all others are LOW)
- TASK-129 → developer (primary developer gets first task per rules)
- TASK-130 → developer2 (load balanced)

Both tasks are web app features that will be visible in the browser, aligning with the Web Integration Rule.
