## Summary

**Assignment Made:**
- **TASK-267** (Apply shared-hub-styles.css to remaining hub pages) → assigned to `developer`

**Current Status:**
- **Page count**: 30 HTML pages (down from 182 at consolidation start - 83% reduction achieved)
- **Backlog**: 1 task (TASK-267 - now assigned)
- **IN_PROGRESS**: 0 tasks
- **Developer workload**: Both developers at 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks

**Consolidation Progress:**
The consolidation phase has been highly successful, reducing the page count from 182 to 30 pages. The only remaining task (TASK-267) is an optimization task to apply the shared CSS file to the remaining hub pages for consistency - this continues the maintenance/optimization work without adding new pages.

All new page creation requests remain blocked per consolidation phase rules.
