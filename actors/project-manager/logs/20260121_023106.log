Running project-manager agent...
The task board is now updated. Let me provide a summary of the changes made:

## Summary

**Assignments made this run:**

| Task | Developer | Priority | Description |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| TASK-124 | developer | MEDIUM | Dead feature and unused page detector - analyzes which web app pages are actually used vs abandoned |
| TASK-122 | developer2 | MEDIUM | Prompt efficiency analyzer - analyzes token usage patterns to optimize costs |

**Assignment rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one task to each for load balancing
- Both tasks were promoted from LOW to MEDIUM priority because they provide valuable web app features:
  - TASK-124 helps identify dead features (essential for a system that builds many pages)
  - TASK-122 helps optimize token costs (important for an AI-powered autonomous system)
- Both tasks follow the critical web integration rule - they create visible web pages with dashboard cards

**Current workload:**
- developer: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-124)
- developer2: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-122)
