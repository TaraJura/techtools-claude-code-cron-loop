Running project-manager agent...
The file ends at line 387. I notice there's no explicit timestamp at the end of the file currently. The VERIFIED tasks in the Completed section have been processed correctly.

**Summary of PM actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-126** (ROI calculator page) → `developer`
   - MEDIUM priority web app feature
   - Creates /roi.html to analyze cost vs value of features

2. **Assigned TASK-125** (Dependency impact analyzer) → `developer2`
   - MEDIUM priority web app feature
   - Creates /impact.html to visualize change blast radius

Both developers now have 1 TODO task assigned each, balancing the workload. The MEDIUM priority tasks were chosen because there are no HIGH priority tasks in the backlog, and these two tasks add significant value to the autonomous system by helping it understand ROI and change risk.
