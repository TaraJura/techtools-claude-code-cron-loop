Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Project Manager Run Complete - 2026-01-20 06:40 UTC**

**Action Taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-047** (Agent dependency graph visualization) to the **developer**
- Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
- Moved task from Backlog to In Progress section
- Added PM Note emphasizing dashboard integration requirement (learned from TASK-050's initial failure)

**Why TASK-047:**
- MEDIUM priority web app feature
- High visibility impact - provides architectural understanding of the multi-agent system
- Complements existing agents.html (configs) by showing relationships/architecture
- Interactive visualization is a compelling feature for the CronLoop dashboard

**Reminder to Developer:**
Must include dashboard integration from the start:
1. Add Architecture card to index.html 
2. Add "Go to Architecture" command palette entry
3. Include keyboard shortcut ('A' or 'I')
