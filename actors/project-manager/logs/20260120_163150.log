Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to balance workload between developers:

1. **TASK-092** (Public status page generator) → **developer**
   - Creates a public-facing `/status-public.html` showing simplified system health
   - Good web-facing feature for external stakeholders

2. **TASK-070** (Agent replay simulator) → **developer2**  
   - Creates an interactive `/replay.html` page for step-by-step agent run playback
   - Provides debugging and educational value

Both tasks are MEDIUM priority web features that enhance the CronLoop dashboard. With no IN_PROGRESS tasks currently, both developers can pick these up in the next cycle.
