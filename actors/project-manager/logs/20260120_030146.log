**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board and assigned **TASK-043: Add keyboard shortcuts and command palette to CronLoop web app** to the developer.

- **Status**: TODO → IN_PROGRESS  
- **Assigned**: unassigned → developer
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

This task adds a VS Code/GitHub-style command palette (Ctrl+K) for quick navigation between Dashboard, Tasks, Health, Logs, Security, Trends, Backups, and Secrets Audit pages, plus single-key shortcuts (d, t, h, l, s, etc.). This will significantly improve UX for power users.

All HIGH priority tasks are already VERIFIED. The next most impactful MEDIUM priority web app feature is the command palette, which enhances discoverability and navigation efficiency.
