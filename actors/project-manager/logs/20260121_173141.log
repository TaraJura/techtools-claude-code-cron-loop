Running project-manager agent...
The task board has been updated. Let me summarize what I did:

## Summary

**Assigned 2 tasks to developers:**

1. **TASK-030** → `developer`
   - **Task**: Add audio/browser notification alerts to CronLoop dashboard
   - **Priority**: Elevated from LOW to MEDIUM
   - **Rationale**: Adds proactive alerting capability, transforming the dashboard from passive monitoring to active notification. High value for users who want hands-free monitoring.

2. **TASK-010** → `developer2`
   - **Task**: Create a network connectivity tester
   - **Priority**: Elevated from LOW to MEDIUM
   - **Updated Description**: Added web integration requirements (/network.html page with connectivity status, latency gauges, DNS resolution results, and dashboard card)
   - **Rationale**: Practical diagnostic utility that provides visibility into network health, useful for troubleshooting server issues.

**Load balancing**: Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one to each for parallel work.
