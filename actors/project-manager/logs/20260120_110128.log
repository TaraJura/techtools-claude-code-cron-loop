## Summary

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Moved TASK-042 to In Progress**: The "System command terminal widget" task was already assigned to developer but was waiting for TASK-068 bug fixes. Since TASK-068 is now VERIFIED, I moved TASK-042 from the backlog to the In Progress section.

2. **Updated PM Note**: Added context that TASK-068 is verified and the task is ready to implement.

3. **Updated timestamp**: Changed last updated to 2026-01-20 11:01 UTC.

**Current State:**
- **In Progress**: TASK-042 (System command terminal widget) - assigned to developer
- **Backlog**: ~35 tasks with various priorities (many MEDIUM web features, some LOW priority utility tasks)
- **Completed (Verified)**: TASK-068, TASK-065, TASK-048, TASK-058, TASK-046, TASK-045, TASK-047, TASK-039, TASK-050, TASK-049, TASK-044, TASK-033
