Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions taken:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - Found 0 tasks currently IN_PROGRESS for both developers
2. **Assigned TASK-017 to developer** - Systemd timer analyzer, upgraded to MEDIUM priority and updated description to require web integration (create /timers.html page with full dashboard integration)
3. **Assigned TASK-018 to developer2** - Swap usage analyzer, upgraded to MEDIUM priority and updated description to require web integration (create /swap.html page with full dashboard integration)
4. **Applied Web Integration Rule** - Both tasks were originally backend-only scripts; I modified them to require visible web dashboard pages per the critical rule that every task must result in something users can see in the web browser
5. **Updated timestamp** to reflect this session

Both developers now have 1 IN_PROGRESS task each, balanced workload.
