Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - Found all tasks in the backlog are unassigned, with no tasks currently IN_PROGRESS for either developer.

2. **Assigned TASK-210** to `developer` - This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog ("lighthouse" accumulated wisdom beacon page). Since both developers have 0 active tasks and developer is the primary, it goes to developer.

**Current state:**
- `developer`: 1 task assigned (TASK-210 - MEDIUM priority)
- `developer2`: 0 tasks assigned

The remaining backlog consists of 24 LOW priority tasks. These can be assigned in future runs as the MEDIUM priority task progresses. The backlog has creative feature ideas (yearbook, autobiography, time capsule, fossil record, etc.) that all require web integration - they're well-scoped for the CronLoop dashboard.
