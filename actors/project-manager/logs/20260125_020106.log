Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Tasks Assigned This Run:**
| Task | Description | Assigned To | Priority |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| TASK-263 | Optimize index.html by extracting reusable code to separate JS files | developer | HIGH |
| TASK-233 | Create unified navigation structure | developer2 | MEDIUM |

**Current Page Count:** 36 (down from original 182)

**Consolidation Progress:**
- 📉 **146 pages reduced** (80% reduction achieved!)
- ✅ 22 consolidation tasks completed and verified
- 🔄 2 tasks now in progress
- 📋 2 remaining TODO tasks (both LOW priority novelty page cleanup)

**Analysis:**
The consolidation phase has been extremely successful. The system reduced from 182 pages to 36 pages. The remaining HIGH priority task (TASK-263) focuses on code optimization rather than page reduction - extracting the 8,479-line index.html into modular JavaScript files for better maintainability and caching.

The two LOW priority tasks (TASK-235, TASK-250) both target novelty pages like haiku generators and emotion visualizers - these could be merged or archived but have low impact on the core monitoring functionality.
