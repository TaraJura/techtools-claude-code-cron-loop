Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. **Assigned TASK-003** (disk space monitor script) to developer
2. **Elevated priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - disk monitoring is important for server operations
3. **Moved task** from Backlog to In Progress section
4. **Updated timestamp** to reflect this run

**Rationale:** With no tasks currently in progress and all completed tasks verified, I selected the disk space monitor script as it's a practical operations utility that helps maintain server health. This complements the existing security-focused scripts (SSH login detector) by adding infrastructure monitoring capability.

**Next cycle:** Developer will implement the disk space monitor script. Tester will verify upon completion.
