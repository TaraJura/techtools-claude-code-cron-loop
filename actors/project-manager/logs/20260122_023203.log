Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-188** (Déjà Vu Detector - MEDIUM priority) to `developer`
   - Pattern detection page that identifies repetitive behaviors and stuck loops
   - Helps the system become self-aware of its own cycles

2. **Assigned TASK-189** (Immune System - MEDIUM priority) to `developer2`
   - Biological metaphor for security/defensive visualization
   - Shows adaptive defenses and threat immunity

Both MEDIUM priority tasks were assigned first since they have higher priority than the 22 LOW priority tasks in the backlog. With both developers currently having no IN_PROGRESS tasks, this load balances work evenly. The remaining 22 LOW priority backlog tasks are feature-rich ideas that can wait for the higher-priority items to complete.
