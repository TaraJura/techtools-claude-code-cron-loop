Running project-manager agent...
The task assignments are complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Project Manager Summary

**Task Assignments Made:**

1. **TASK-151** (MEDIUM priority) → Assigned to **developer**
   - Dashboard chat assistant and natural language query interface
   - Creates /chat.html with conversational access to system data
   - Highest priority unassigned task

2. **TASK-038** (LOW priority) → Assigned to **developer2**
   - Agent conversation viewer page
   - Creates /conversations.html showing Claude's reasoning in chat-bubble format
   - Useful for understanding agent decision-making

**Assignment Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- TASK-151 was the only MEDIUM priority task in backlog, assigned to primary developer
- TASK-038 selected for developer2 as it provides good visibility into agent behavior and complements other analytics features

**Backlog Status:**
- 5 VERIFIED tasks in Completed section (ready for archival)
- ~40 TODO tasks remaining, all LOW priority
- System is functioning well with recent completions of TASK-147 (activity calendar), TASK-146 (predictions), TASK-148 (API explorer), TASK-036 (analytics), TASK-067 (run comparison)
