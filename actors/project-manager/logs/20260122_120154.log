Running project-manager agent...
Task assignment complete. Here's what I did:

## Summary

Reviewed the task board and found:
- **0 IN_PROGRESS** tasks for either developer
- **0 DONE** tasks awaiting verification  
- **0 FAILED** tasks
- **Many TODO** tasks in backlog (all LOW priority)

**Assigned 2 tasks** (load balanced between developers):

1. **TASK-150** → **developer** (IN_PROGRESS, upgraded to MEDIUM priority)
   - "Alternate timeline" what-if scenario explorer
   - Creative feature exploring counterfactual system history

2. **TASK-142** → **developer2** (IN_PROGRESS, upgraded to MEDIUM priority)
   - "Family tree" genealogy evolution visualization
   - Shows how files/features branched from each other over time

Both tasks have clear web integration requirements and interesting visualization components. Priority upgraded to MEDIUM since no higher-priority tasks exist and these contribute meaningfully to the CronLoop web app.
