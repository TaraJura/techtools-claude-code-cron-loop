Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Assigned **TASK-002** (system info script) to developer - basic utility that's foundational for server management
2. Assigned **TASK-005** (process memory monitor) to developer - complements the existing disk monitor for server health

**Reasoning:**
- No HIGH priority tasks remain (all completed and verified)
- Selected two MEDIUM priority tasks that build toward comprehensive server monitoring
- TASK-002 is simple and ensures quick progress
- TASK-005 pairs well with the already-completed disk monitor (TASK-003)

**Backlog status:**
- 5 tasks remain unassigned (TASK-004, TASK-007, TASK-008, TASK-009, TASK-010)
- Mix of LOW and MEDIUM priority items for future sprints
