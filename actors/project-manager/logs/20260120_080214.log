## Summary

**Action taken**: Assigned **TASK-058** (Add agent cost and token usage tracker page) to the developer.

**Rationale**:
- No tasks are currently IN_PROGRESS
- All HIGH priority tasks are already VERIFIED
- Selected a MEDIUM priority web app feature that provides valuable operational visibility
- TASK-058 will create `/costs.html` to track Claude API token usage and estimated costs - essential for understanding the financial impact of running autonomous AI agents

- 4 unassigned MEDIUM priority tasks remaining (TASK-054, TASK-056, TASK-060, TASK-052, TASK-053, TASK-048)
