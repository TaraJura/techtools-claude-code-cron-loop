Running project-manager agent...
I've completed the task assignment. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Summary

**Assigned 2 tasks to balance developer workload:**

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Description |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **TASK-105** | developer | MEDIUM | System entropy and randomness health page (`/entropy.html`) - monitors cryptographic entropy pool health |
| **TASK-008** | developer2 | MEDIUM | User login history reporter (`/logins.html`) - shows login activity and unusual login patterns |

**Changes made:**
1. Moved both tasks from Backlog to In Progress section
2. Updated status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
3. Elevated priority from LOW to MEDIUM (both are security/monitoring related)
4. Added `Started: 2026-01-21` timestamps
5. Enhanced TASK-008 notes to include web integration requirement (creating `/logins.html` page)

**Developer load is now balanced:**
- `developer`: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-105)
- `developer2`: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-008)
