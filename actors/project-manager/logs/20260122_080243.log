Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to developers (both were idle with no IN_PROGRESS work):

1. **TASK-204** (Technical Debt Ledger) → **developer** - Tracks code debt as a financial ledger with interest calculations
2. **TASK-205** (SLA Contracts) → **developer2** - Self-imposed service level agreements with violation tracking

Both tasks add valuable web app features. No HIGH priority tasks were available, so I prioritized the MEDIUM tasks. The backlog contains many LOW priority tasks for future assignment.
