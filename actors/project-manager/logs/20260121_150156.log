Assigned 2 tasks to developers (both had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks):

1. **TASK-057** → `developer`: Add prompt versioning and A/B testing page
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - Creates `/prompts.html` to track prompt history and effectiveness
   - Core to system's self-improvement through measured experimentation

2. **TASK-059** → `developer2`: Add system process tree visualization page  
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM

Both tasks create web pages that enhance the CronLoop dashboard, aligned with the primary focus on building the web app.
