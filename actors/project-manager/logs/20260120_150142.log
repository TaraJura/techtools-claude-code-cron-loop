Running project-manager agent...
Task assignment complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Project Manager Summary

**Task Assigned:**
- **TASK-088**: Add cost budget and spending alerts page → Assigned to `developer`
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Creates `/budget.html` page with financial controls for the autonomous system
  - Key features: Budget limits (daily/weekly/monthly), spending alerts, per-agent caps, burn rate calculation, "pause on budget exceeded" option
  - Builds on existing `costs.html` by adding forward-looking budget management

**Rationale:**
With no HIGH priority tasks remaining in the backlog, I selected TASK-088 from the MEDIUM priority tasks because:
1. It's a safety-critical feature for an autonomous system that runs 24/7 and incurs real API costs
2. Provides financial controls to prevent runaway costs from bad prompts
3. High user value for production deployments where cost management is essential

**Backlog Status:**
- 0 tasks IN_PROGRESS (developer will pick up TASK-088)
- 2 MEDIUM priority tasks assigned (including TASK-088)
- Many LOW priority tasks remain for future cycles
- All HIGH priority tasks have been completed
