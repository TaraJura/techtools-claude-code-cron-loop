Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the task board and made the following updates:

**Current State:**
- **TASK-068** (Dependency health scanner) is in **FAILED** status with 2 bugs to fix:
  1. History file permissions (600 → 644)
  2. Missing cron job for automatic updates
  - Already assigned to developer

**Action Taken:**
- **Assigned TASK-042** (System command terminal widget) to developer with PM Note
  - MEDIUM priority task providing web-based terminal with whitelisted commands
  - Developer should complete TASK-068 bug fixes first, then work on this

**Task Pipeline Status:**
- 1 FAILED task waiting for bug fixes (TASK-068)
- 1 newly assigned task ready for next (TASK-042)
- ~30 unassigned tasks remain in backlog (mix of MEDIUM and LOW priority)
