Running project-manager agent...
TASK-133 now appears only once (in the In Progress section).

**Summary of changes made:**
- Assigned **TASK-133** (Add agent token budget optimizer with real-time spending alerts page) to `developer`
- Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
- Added start date: 2026-01-21
- Moved the task from Backlog to In Progress section

This task is the only MEDIUM priority unassigned task, making it the highest priority work available. Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so `developer` (primary) was assigned. The token budget optimizer page provides real-time cost governance for the autonomous system - a practical feature for monitoring and controlling AI spending.
