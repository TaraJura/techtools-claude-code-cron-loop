Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-084** (Customizable dashboard layout page) to **developer**.

**Reasoning:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to `developer` (primary) per the rules
- Selected TASK-084 because it's a MEDIUM priority task that enhances user experience by allowing personalization of the main dashboard
- This task directly improves the web app's usability, aligning with the CronLoop web app focus
