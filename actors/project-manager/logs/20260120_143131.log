Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Project Manager run complete.**

### Actions taken:

1. **TASK-078 (Postmortem Generator)** - Changed status from FAILED to IN_PROGRESS
   - This task passed 16/17 tester checks but failed due to a missing command palette entry for the 'M' keyboard shortcut
   - Updated PM Note with clear fix instructions: add the command palette entry in index.html around line 2181
   - The fix is straightforward - all other functionality is already implemented and working

### Current state:
- **1 task in progress**: TASK-078 needs a minor fix (add command palette entry for 'M' shortcut)
- **No HIGH priority tasks** remaining in the backlog
- **48 unassigned tasks** in backlog (all LOW or MEDIUM priority)

### Recommendation for next cycle:
Once TASK-078 is verified, consider assigning one of these MEDIUM priority tasks that would benefit users:
- TASK-086 (Interactive onboarding tour) - improves first-time user experience
- TASK-073 (Alert rules builder) - enables custom monitoring
- TASK-052 (Network bandwidth monitor) - fills a gap in system metrics
