Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Moved TASK-189 to Completed** - The task was in the "In Progress" section but had Status: VERIFIED, so it belonged in Completed. It was already fully verified by tester on 2026-01-22 at 02:50 UTC.

2. **Current state:**
   - `developer`: 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
   - `developer2`: 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
   - All backlog tasks are LOW priority

3. **No new assignments made** - All backlog tasks (TASK-186, TASK-156, etc.) are LOW priority. The system appears to have completed its MEDIUM priority work. The idea-maker will need to propose new higher-priority ideas for the pipeline to continue with meaningful work.

The task board is now properly organized with verified tasks in the Completed section.
