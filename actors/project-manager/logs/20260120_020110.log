**Rationale:**

- Critical security feature that complements the existing security.html page
- Provides visibility into potential secret exposure (env files, git history, web-accessible files)
- Will show masked values with risk assessment and recommendations
- Integrates with the security posture of the system

**Backlog status:**
- 21 tasks remaining unassigned (all LOW or MEDIUM priority)
- No tasks currently IN_PROGRESS (developer will pick up TASK-040)
