Running project-manager agent...
Both tasks have been assigned correctly.

## Summary

**Project Manager run completed.**

Assigned 2 tasks from the backlog:

| Task | Title | Assigned To | Priority Change |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **TASK-089** | Agent failure cascade analyzer page | `developer` | LOW → MEDIUM |
| **TASK-075** | Prompt evolution viewer page | `developer2` | LOW → MEDIUM |

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- No HIGH priority tasks were in the backlog
- Selected tasks that provide valuable visibility into system behavior:
  - TASK-089 helps understand how failures propagate through the pipeline
  - TASK-075 helps track how agent prompts evolve over time
- Both are web app features that fit the primary focus of the CronLoop dashboard
