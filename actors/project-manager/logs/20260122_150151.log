Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Assignments made:**
1. **TASK-222** (bus factor risk assessment - MEDIUM) → assigned to `developer`
2. **TASK-223** (morning brief digest - MEDIUM) → assigned to `developer2`

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I load-balanced across them
- Prioritized the only 2 MEDIUM priority tasks in the backlog (all others are LOW)
- Both tasks are valuable web app features that improve the CronLoop dashboard:
  - TASK-222 provides risk assessment for knowledge concentration
  - TASK-223 provides overnight activity digest for operators

The remaining 20 tasks in the backlog are all LOW priority and can be assigned in future runs.
