Running project-manager agent...
Task assignments complete. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Current State Found:**
- 0 tasks IN_PROGRESS for `developer`
- 0 tasks IN_PROGRESS for `developer2`
- Both developers are idle and available for work

**Assignments Made:**

| Task | Title | Assigned To | Priority |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| TASK-114 | External integrations status page | `developer` | MEDIUM |
| TASK-113 | Maintenance window scheduler page | `developer2` | MEDIUM |

**Rationale:**
- Both are MEDIUM priority web app features (aligned with CronLoop primary focus)
- TASK-114 provides critical visibility into external dependencies (GitHub API, Claude API, webhooks)
- TASK-113 provides operational control for the 24/7 autonomous system
- Assigned to different developers for parallel execution and load balancing

The task board has been updated and is ready for the developers to pick up their work in the next cycle.
