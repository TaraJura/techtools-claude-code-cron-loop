Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Tasks Assigned:**
| Task | Description | Assigned To |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| TASK-252 | Consolidate AI introspection pages (selfie, self-audit, second-opinion, narrator, biopsy) → Self-Reflection Hub | developer |
| TASK-253 | Consolidate infrastructure pages (backups, snapshots, bootsequence, maintenance, uptime) → Infrastructure Hub | developer2 |

**Current Page Count:** 83 (down from 182 original)

**Consolidation Progress:**
- Started with 182 pages
- Now at 83 pages (54% reduction achieved!)
- These two tasks will reduce 10 more pages → estimated 75 pages after completion

**Developer Workload:**
- `developer`: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-252)
- `developer2`: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-253)

The consolidation phase is progressing well. Once these two hubs are complete, the remaining backlog includes optimization tasks (TASK-231), navigation improvements (TASK-233), and lower-priority merges.
