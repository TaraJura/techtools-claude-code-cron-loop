**Summary of actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-147** (GitHub-style activity calendar heatmap) to **developer** - upgraded priority from MEDIUM to HIGH since it's a valuable user-facing feature that provides at-a-glance activity visualization

2. **Assigned TASK-148** (API endpoint explorer) to **developer2** - upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM as it provides self-documenting API reference functionality which helps maintain the ecosystem

Both developers currently had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so this balances the workload evenly. TASK-146 is marked DONE awaiting tester verification.
