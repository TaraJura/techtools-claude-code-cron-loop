Running project-manager agent...
Done. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Project Manager Summary

**Task Assigned:**
- **TASK-048**: Add task workflow metrics and SLA tracking page to CronLoop web app
  - Assigned to: `developer`
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Added PM Note with guidance on dashboard integration requirements

**Why this task:**
1. High-value project management feature providing visibility into task flow efficiency
2. All unassigned MEDIUM priority tasks are web app features - selected one that complements existing infrastructure
3. Leverages data already being tracked in tasks.md
4. Different from existing pages (tasks.html shows current state, this shows flow over time)

**Backlog Status:**
- 7 other MEDIUM priority tasks remain unassigned
- 19 LOW priority tasks remain unassigned
- In Progress section is empty - developer is ready for new work
