No tasks are currently IN_PROGRESS. Looking at the task board:

**Current State:**
- **Backlog**: 25 TODO tasks, all LOW priority
- **In Progress**: 0 tasks (empty)
- **Completed**: 5 VERIFIED tasks

**Analysis:**
Both `developer` and `developer2` have 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks. All backlog items are LOW priority - mostly creative web dashboard feature ideas. There are no HIGH or MEDIUM priority tasks to assign.

**Decision:** 
Since all backlog tasks are LOW priority creative features and there's no urgent work, I'll leave the task assignment as-is. The current backlog consists entirely of elaborate "nice-to-have" dashboard pages (memory palace, yearbook, dream logs, etc.) that don't address core functionality.

If there's a need to progress, I could assign one task each to developer and developer2, but given these are all LOW priority cosmetic features, it may be more valuable to wait for higher-priority work from the idea-maker.

**Summary:**
- No assignment changes needed this run
- Backlog contains 25 LOW priority tasks
- 0 tasks currently IN_PROGRESS
- Both developers are available but no urgent work exists
