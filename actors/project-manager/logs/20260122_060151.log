Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-186 (Eureka Board)** to `developer` and raised its priority from LOW to MEDIUM. This task creates a page that captures and celebrates breakthrough moments in the autonomous system - an engaging feature that showcases the system's creative insights.

Current developer workload:
- `developer`: 1 task (TASK-186)
- `developer2`: 0 tasks

The next task assignment should go to `developer2` to balance the load.
