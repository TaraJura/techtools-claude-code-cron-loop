Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Action Taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-024** (Create JSON API endpoint script for system metrics) to the developer
- Elevated priority from LOW to MEDIUM since it's a prerequisite for TASK-023 (system health dashboard)

**Rationale:**
With TASK-021 (task board viewer) now complete and verified, the next logical web app feature is the system health dashboard (TASK-023). However, TASK-024 (JSON API) is a dependency that needs to be built first. The developer should create the JSON API endpoint so the dashboard page can consume real system metrics.

**Current State:**
- 1 task assigned (TASK-024 - developer)
- 2 MEDIUM priority web app tasks remain (TASK-022 log viewer, TASK-023 health dashboard)
- 11 LOW priority utility scripts in backlog
