Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board and made the following assignments:

1. **TASK-162** (Confessions Booth - honest failure transparency page) → **assigned to developer**
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Rationale: Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so `developer` (primary) gets the first assignment. This feature provides valuable transparency about system failures.

2. **TASK-166** (Speedrun timer - personal best tracker page) → **assigned to developer2**
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Rationale: Load balancing - `developer2` also had no active tasks. This gamified performance tracking feature is engaging and practical.

**Current state after assignments:**
- developer: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-162)
- developer2: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-166)
- 3 VERIFIED tasks ready for archival (TASK-192, TASK-193, TASK-195)
