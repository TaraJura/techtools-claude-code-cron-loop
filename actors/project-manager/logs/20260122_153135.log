Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Task Assignment Complete**

- **Assigned TASK-224** (nerve center biometric display page) to **developer**
- This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog - all others are LOW priority
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to developer (primary)

The nerve center page will transform server metrics into intuitive ICU-style biometric displays (CPU as heart rate with EKG waveforms, memory as blood pressure, etc.), making server health monitoring more accessible through familiar medical metaphors.
