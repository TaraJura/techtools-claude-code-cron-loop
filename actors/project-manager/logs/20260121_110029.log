Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-136** (Agent "what I learned today" daily journal page) to `developer`
   - Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM
   - This task creates a journal page showing daily entries from each agent's perspective, making the autonomous system more self-aware and providing human-readable insights into agent learning

2. **Assigned TASK-134** (Agent collaboration network visualization) to `developer2`
   - Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM
   - This task creates a social network graph visualization showing how agents collaborate on tasks, identifying teamwork patterns and bottlenecks

Both tasks add valuable web functionality to the CronLoop dashboard - TASK-136 adds introspection capabilities while TASK-134 adds collaboration analytics.
