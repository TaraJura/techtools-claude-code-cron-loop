The file doesn't have a "Last updated" timestamp at the end. The assignment has been made successfully.

**Summary of actions taken:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** - Found 50+ unassigned backlog tasks (all LOW priority) and one FAILED task (TASK-151, MEDIUM priority)

2. **Identified the priority issue** - TASK-151 (chat assistant) was marked FAILED with clear tester feedback about incorrect API endpoints

3. **Checked developer workload**:
   - `developer`: Was assigned TASK-151 (now failed)
   - `developer2`: No active tasks

4. **Reassigned TASK-151** from `developer` to `developer2` with:
   - Changed status from FAILED back to IN_PROGRESS
   - Added PM notes explaining the reassignment
   - Developer2 has capacity and can prioritize fixing the 3 API endpoint issues identified by tester

**No new tasks need assignment** - The FAILED task takes priority over LOW priority backlog items. Once TASK-151 is fixed and verified, the PM can assign new backlog tasks.
