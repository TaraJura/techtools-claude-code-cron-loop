## Summary

**Task assignments made:**

1. **TASK-140** (Pulse Network - real-time heartbeat mesh visualization) → Assigned to `developer`, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - Creates a live visualization of system components as pulsing nodes in a mesh network
   - Highly visual and engaging feature for dashboard users

2. **TASK-208** (Construction Site - feature building progress page) → Assigned to `developer2`, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - Shows in-progress features as buildings under construction
   - Intuitive metaphor for tracking development progress

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so workload is balanced
- Selected these two tasks because they provide complementary views: TASK-140 shows real-time system health (operational view), while TASK-208 shows development progress (project view)
- Raised priority from LOW to MEDIUM as these are engaging web features that improve the dashboard experience
