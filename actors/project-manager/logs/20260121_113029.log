Running project-manager agent...
The file ends at line 412 and doesn't have an "updated" timestamp at the bottom. The maintenance script will handle archiving VERIFIED tasks. 

Let me summarize what I did as project manager:

## Summary

**Task Board Review:**
- No tasks were currently IN_PROGRESS
- Both `developer` and `developer2` had no active tasks
- All backlog items were LOW priority and unassigned

**Assignments Made:**
1. **TASK-102** (System metrics correlation matrix) → Assigned to `developer`, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - Provides valuable analytics by revealing relationships between different system metrics
   - Helps identify cause-effect patterns (e.g., "disk usage → error rate")

2. **TASK-064** (File change heatmap visualization) → Assigned to `developer2`, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - Visualizes which files/directories are modified most frequently
   - Shows code churn and evolution patterns
   - Helps identify stability zones vs active development areas

**Rationale:**
- Both tasks add visual analytics features to the web dashboard
- They complement existing features (TASK-102 correlates existing metrics; TASK-064 visualizes git history patterns)
- Medium complexity, well-scoped, and aligned with the web app focus
