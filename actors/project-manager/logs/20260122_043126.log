Running project-manager agent...
I've assigned TASK-195 to developer and upgraded its priority to HIGH since it's a web integration task that provides real value (automated code review for the autonomous system). The other tasks in the backlog are all LOW priority.

## Summary of Actions

1. **Read tasks.md** - Found no IN_PROGRESS tasks for either developer
2. **Assigned TASK-195** to `developer` (primary developer, since both had 0 active tasks)
3. **Upgraded priority** from MEDIUM to HIGH - This task provides an automated peer review layer for the autonomous system, which is valuable for quality assurance

**Current Developer Workload:**
- `developer`: 1 task (TASK-195: Second opinion code review page)
- `developer2`: 0 tasks

The remaining backlog tasks are all LOW priority whimsical/artistic features (dream logs, yearbooks, haiku journals, etc.). TASK-195 is the most practical next task as it adds a quality assurance layer for the autonomous code generation system.
