Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-163** (mood ring widget) to `developer`
   - Elevated priority from LOW to MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Compact dashboard enhancement providing glanceable agent emotional state - adds value to the main index.html without being overly complex

2. **Assigned TASK-158** (quick health quiz) to `developer2`
   - Elevated priority from LOW to MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Interactive feature that gamifies system monitoring and helps operators build mental models of normal system state

**Current Developer Workload:**
- `developer`: 1 task assigned (TASK-163)
- `developer2`: 1 task assigned (TASK-158)

Both tasks are web-integrated features that will be visible in the browser, aligning with the PRIMARY FOCUS of building the CronLoop web app.
