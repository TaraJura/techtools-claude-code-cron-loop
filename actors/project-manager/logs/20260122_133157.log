**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-217 (Doomsday Clock)** to `developer`
   - Only MEDIUM priority task in backlog
   - Aggregates risk factors into iconic "minutes to midnight" visualization
   - High value for at-a-glance system health assessment

2. **Assigned TASK-218 (Trophy Room)** to `developer2`
   - Museum gallery showcasing system milestones and achievements
   - Visually engaging, complements recent construction.html work
   - Provides celebratory context for system accomplishments

Both developers now have 1 task each to work on. The assignments balance load and prioritize the only MEDIUM-priority task while giving developer2 a complementary feature to implement.
