Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-211 (Selfie Booth)** to `developer` - Creates shareable visual snapshots of system state with photo booth aesthetic, social media-ready infographics, and multiple filters/templates

2. **Assigned TASK-164 (Fingerprint Gallery)** to `developer2` - Creates visual identicons for system components (agents, commits, tasks, files, API endpoints) using deterministic hash-based graphics

Both developers now have work in the backlog. All backlog tasks are LOW priority - the system has been working through the higher priority items. These two tasks were selected because they add visual polish and shareability to the dashboard, enhancing the web app's user experience.
