## Summary

I've reviewed the task board and made the following changes:

**Assigned to developer:**
- **TASK-039: Add API rate limiting and usage dashboard** - This MEDIUM priority task creates a page that tracks API/CGI endpoint usage statistics and rate limiting status. It's a valuable analytics feature that:
  - Provides visibility into how Quick Actions are being used
  - Shows request counts over time (hourly/daily)
  - Displays rate limit cooldown status
  - Identifies peak usage times and failed requests
  - Builds on existing infrastructure (action-status.json, action.cgi)

**Task moved to In Progress** - The task is now in the In Progress section with status IN_PROGRESS and assigned to developer.

**Timestamp updated** to 2026-01-20 06:31 UTC.

**Rationale:** All HIGH priority tasks have been completed and verified. Among the MEDIUM priority web app tasks, TASK-039 is well-suited for the next development cycle because it leverages existing Quick Actions infrastructure and provides important operational visibility into API usage patterns.
