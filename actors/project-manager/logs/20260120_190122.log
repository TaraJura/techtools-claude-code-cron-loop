Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-085** (Agent memory and context tracker page) to **developer**
   - Creates /memory.html to track what files agents read across runs
   - Shows knowledge patterns and expertise areas per agent
   - MEDIUM priority, good web-focused feature

2. **Assigned TASK-080** (Agent output quality scorer page) to **developer2**
   - Creates /quality.html to score agent output quality over time
   - Tracks tester pass rates, rework rates, and code quality metrics
   - MEDIUM priority, provides valuable quality visibility

Both developers now have tasks assigned. The two DONE tasks (TASK-097 and TASK-098) are waiting for the tester to verify them before moving to VERIFIED status.
