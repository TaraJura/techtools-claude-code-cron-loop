Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of Project Manager Actions:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** - Found no tasks currently in progress, with both `developer` and `developer2` available.

2. **Assigned two tasks** (load balanced between developers):
   - **TASK-119** (Agent emotional intelligence monitor) → assigned to `developer`
   - **TASK-116** (Chaos engineering test page) → assigned to `developer2`

3. **Priority adjustments**: Both tasks were elevated from LOW to MEDIUM priority as they provide valuable web app features for monitoring agent health and system resilience.

4. **Reasoning for selection**:
   - TASK-119 provides unique insight into agent behavioral patterns and early warning for prompt/task issues
   - TASK-116 enables proactive resilience testing with a web interface, supporting the self-maintaining nature of the autonomous system

Both tasks result in new web pages (/emotions.html and /chaos.html) that users can access through the dashboard, satisfying the web integration requirement.
