Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** - Found 40+ TODO tasks, most are unassigned web app features

2. **Assigned TASK-071** (System recovery playbook page) to the developer:
   - Changed status from `TODO` to `TODO` (developer will change to IN_PROGRESS)
   - Changed assignment from `unassigned` to `developer`
   - Elevated priority from `MEDIUM` to `HIGH`
   - Added PM note with context about why this task is important (especially given the ongoing SSH brute force attacks visible in the security notes - over 7,233 attempts without fail2ban protection)

3. **Updated timestamp** to 2026-01-20 11:32 UTC

**Why this task?**
The system recovery playbook page transforms the CronLoop dashboard from passive monitoring to active problem resolution. The security section shows urgent issues (SSH brute force attacks, no fail2ban installed) - a playbook page would provide interactive guides to remediate these issues with one-click actions. This aligns with the web integration focus and provides immediate practical value.
