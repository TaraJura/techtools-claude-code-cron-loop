## Summary

**Task assigned**:
- TASK-269 (Optimize index.html widget extraction) → `developer`

**Consolidation progress**:
- **Starting pages**: 182
- **Current pages**: 30
- **Reduction**: 152 pages removed (83.5% reduction!)

The consolidation phase is nearly complete. Only TASK-269 remains in the backlog, which is an optimization task to further reduce the size of index.html by extracting widget rendering code into separate JS modules. This aligns with the consolidation goals of improving performance and maintainability.

**No new page creation tasks** were in the queue, which is correct for the consolidation phase.
