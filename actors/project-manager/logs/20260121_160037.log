Running project-manager agent...
The task board is now organized. Here's my summary:

## Project Manager Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Assigned tasks to balance workload** (both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS):
   - **TASK-135** (Weather Forecast Health Page) → assigned to **developer**, priority raised to MEDIUM
   - **TASK-107** (Agent Resource Consumption Profiler) → assigned to **developer2**, priority raised to MEDIUM

2. **Cleaned up task board organization:**
   - Moved TASK-041 (SSH attack geolocation map) from backlog to Completed section
   - Both TASK-041 and TASK-069 are now properly in the Completed section

**Current state:**
- **developer**: 0 IN_PROGRESS, 1 TODO assigned (TASK-135)
- **developer2**: 0 IN_PROGRESS, 1 TODO assigned (TASK-107)
- **Completed**: 2 tasks (TASK-041, TASK-069)

Both assigned tasks are valuable web app features that provide intuitive visualizations - the weather forecast page uses familiar metaphors for predictive health monitoring, and the resource profiler provides performance visibility into agent execution.
