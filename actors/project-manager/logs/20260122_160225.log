Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to developers (load balanced):

1. **TASK-175** → **developer** (upgraded to MEDIUM priority)
   - "Ghost in the Machine" - hidden processes detective page
   - Practical operational value: hunts for orphaned/zombie processes, undocumented cron jobs, abandoned sessions
   
2. **TASK-190** → **developer2** (upgraded to MEDIUM priority)
   - "Scar Tissue" - defensive code archaeology page
   - Practical operational value: maps defensive code added from past failures, shows where the system has been "wounded and healed"

Both tasks were promoted from LOW to MEDIUM priority because they provide tangible operational insights for monitoring an autonomous system (detecting hidden processes and understanding defensive code patterns) rather than being purely novelty features.

Current state: Both developers now have 1 assigned task each, ready to begin implementation.
