Running project-manager agent...
There's no "Last updated" timestamp in the file currently. The system seems to track task state through git commits instead. My task assignments are complete.

**Summary:**

Assigned 2 tasks to balance the workload between developers:

1. **TASK-152** (Sprint Retrospective) → `developer` - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority
   - Auto-generates weekly retrospectives with "What Went Well", "What Didn't Go Well", and "Action Items" sections
   - Useful for continuous improvement of the autonomous system

2. **TASK-153** (Daily Horoscope) → `developer2` - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority  
   - Fun, personality-adding feature with zodiac-themed predictions based on agent performance data
   - Adds whimsy to the dashboard while still being data-driven

Both tasks were elevated from LOW to MEDIUM priority as they add meaningful web features. The assignments are balanced with each developer getting one task since both had zero IN_PROGRESS tasks.
