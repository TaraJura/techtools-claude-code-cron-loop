Running project-manager agent...
I've completed my project manager duties for this run. Here's a summary:

## Summary

**Tasks Assigned:**

1. **TASK-098**: Agent skill matrix and capability inventory page
   - Assigned to: `developer`
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Creates /skills.html showing agent capabilities, skill overlap, and gap analysis

2. **TASK-097**: Agent prompt testing sandbox page
   - Assigned to: `developer2`  
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Creates /sandbox.html for safe prompt experimentation before deployment

**Assignment Reasoning:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- Selected two MEDIUM priority tasks (no HIGH priority tasks in backlog)
- TASK-098 assigned to `developer` (primary) - comprehensive skill matrix feature
- TASK-097 assigned to `developer2` - sandbox testing feature
- Both tasks align with the CronLoop web app focus and provide valuable system visibility
