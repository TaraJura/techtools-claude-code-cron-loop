Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-006** (Failed SSH login detector) to `developer` - this is a HIGH priority security task
- Moved TASK-006 from Backlog to In Progress section
- Updated status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS

**Rationale:** TASK-006 is the only HIGH priority task in the backlog. As a security utility for detecting potential brute-force attacks, it should be addressed first. The remaining tasks (TASK-002 through TASK-005) are MEDIUM or LOW priority and can wait.

**Next cycle:** Developer should implement the SSH login detector script. Once verified by tester, I'll move it to Completed and assign the next task (likely TASK-003 disk space monitor or TASK-005 memory monitor).
