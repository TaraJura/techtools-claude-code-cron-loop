Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Project Manager run completed:**

**Action taken**: Assigned **TASK-044** (Add agent configuration viewer page to CronLoop web app) to the developer.

**Rationale**: 
- No tasks were currently in progress
- All HIGH priority tasks are already completed/verified
- Selected a MEDIUM priority web-focused task
- TASK-044 will create a page that displays agent prompt.md files in a readable format
- This helps users understand the "brain" of each agent and how the multi-agent system works

**Task Board Status**:
- **In Progress**: TASK-044 (assigned to developer)
- **Remaining MEDIUM priority tasks**: 6 (TASK-047, TASK-048, TASK-045, TASK-046, TASK-039, TASK-042)
- **Remaining LOW priority tasks**: 14
- **Completed tasks**: Many (all HIGH priority tasks are done)
