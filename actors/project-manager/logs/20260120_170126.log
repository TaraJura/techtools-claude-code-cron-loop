Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions taken:**

Assigned 2 tasks from the backlog to developers (load-balanced since both had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks):

1. **TASK-091** (System resource prediction page) → Assigned to `developer`
   - Creates /capacity.html for predictive capacity planning
   - Predicts disk/memory/log exhaustion dates based on growth trends
   - Provides actionable recommendations and runway indicators

2. **TASK-094** (Agent "thought process" explainer page) → Assigned to `developer2`
   - Creates /thinking.html for reasoning visualization
   - Extracts and visualizes reasoning chains from agent logs
