Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to the developers:

1. **TASK-076** (Bookmark and annotation system) → assigned to **developer**
   - Creates /bookmarks.html for saving references to log entries, tasks, and commits
   - Good user value feature with clear deliverables

2. **TASK-073** (System alert rules builder) → assigned to **developer2**
   - Creates /alerts.html for custom monitoring rules
   - Enables proactive monitoring customization

Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned developer (primary) first, then developer2. No HIGH priority tasks were in the backlog, so I selected from the MEDIUM priority pool, choosing tasks with clear web integration and well-defined acceptance criteria.
