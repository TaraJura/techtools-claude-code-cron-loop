Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-053** (Configuration drift detection page) to `developer`
   - MEDIUM priority security feature that monitors system config files for unexpected changes
   - Practical utility for detecting unauthorized modifications

2. **Assigned TASK-072** (Agent communication timeline page) to `developer2`
   - MEDIUM priority visibility feature showing tool calls and file operations as a timeline
   - Provides execution-level visibility into agent behavior

Both developers were idle (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each), so I balanced the workload by assigning one task to each. I selected MEDIUM priority tasks that provide practical value to the web dashboard.
