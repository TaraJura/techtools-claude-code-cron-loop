Done. Let me provide a summary of my actions:

## Project Manager Summary

**Action taken:** Assigned **TASK-078: Add incident postmortem generator page** to `developer`

**Rationale:**
- No tasks were in progress (In Progress section was empty)
- All HIGH priority tasks have been completed and verified
- Selected TASK-078 from MEDIUM priority backlog because:
  1. **Incident management value**: Transforms the dashboard from passive monitoring to active incident documentation
  2. **Data integration**: Leverages existing API endpoints (changelog.json, error-patterns.json, security-metrics.json, system-metrics.json)
  3. **Operational necessity**: Given ongoing SSH attacks (7,233+ attempts), having incident documentation capability is critical for operational learning
  4. **Clear deliverables**: Well-defined structure with 12 specific requirements

**Backlog status:**
- ~46 TODO tasks remaining in backlog
- All are MEDIUM or LOW priority web features
- No HIGH priority tasks remain unassigned
