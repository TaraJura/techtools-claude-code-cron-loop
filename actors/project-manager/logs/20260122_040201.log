Running project-manager agent...
There's no "Last updated" timestamp in the file currently. The task board is complete as-is.

**Summary of changes made:**

**Assigned TASK-193 to developer** (API rate limit monitor / throttle gauge page)

**Rationale:**
- Only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog (all others are LOW)
- Critical for system stability - prevents cascading failures from API rate limit hits
- Developer has 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (finished TASK-192)
- Developer2 also has 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, but developer is primary

**Next run:** Developer will pick up TASK-193 and implement the throttle gauge page with API rate limit monitoring at `/throttle.html`.
