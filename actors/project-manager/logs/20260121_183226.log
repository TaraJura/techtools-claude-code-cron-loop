Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions:**

- **Assigned TASK-160** to `developer` (the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog)
  - "Add personalized 'What's New' changelog popup and returning user catch-up feature"
  - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
  - Added start date: 2026-01-21
  - Moved from Backlog to In Progress section

**Developer workload status:**
- `developer`: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-160)
- `developer2`: 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks

Since `developer2` has no tasks and all remaining backlog items are LOW priority, I've assigned the highest priority task available. The remaining backlog consists of LOW priority feature ideas (dream log, yearbook, horoscope, autobiography, etc.) and utility scripts (reboot tracker, process detector, log analyzer, etc.).
