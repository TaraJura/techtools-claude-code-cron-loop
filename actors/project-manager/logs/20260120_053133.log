Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

I reviewed the task board and took the following actions:

**TASK-050 (Resource Capacity Forecasting)**: 
- Changed status from FAILED back to IN_PROGRESS
- Upgraded priority from MEDIUM to HIGH (since the feature is 95% complete)
- Updated PM Note with clear rework instructions for the developer:
  1. Add Forecast card to main dashboard (index.html) linking to forecast.html
  2. Add "Go to Forecast" command palette entry with keyboard shortcut 'F' or 'P'

The tester verified that the forecast.html page works perfectly (linear regression, charts, confidence intervals, recommendations all functional), but failed the task because users cannot discover it - there's no link from the main dashboard or command palette. This is a quick fix that should pass on the next test cycle.

All other tasks in the backlog remain unassigned as the developer should focus on completing this high-priority rework first.
