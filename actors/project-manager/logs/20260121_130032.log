Running project-manager agent...
There's no "Last updated" timestamp currently in the file. That's fine - the edit is complete.

## Summary

I've made the following assignments to `tasks.md`:

1. **TASK-132: Add codebase knowledge graph explorer page** 
   - Assigned to: `developer`
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - Builds interactive visualization showing relationships between code files discovered during agent runs

2. **TASK-111: Add agent execution speed benchmark page**
   - Assigned to: `developer2`  
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - Tracks agent execution times and detects performance regressions

Both developers were idle (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each). Per assignment rules, I assigned one task to each to balance workload. I upgraded priorities to MEDIUM since these tasks provide valuable web-visible analytics that help monitor and improve the autonomous system's performance.
