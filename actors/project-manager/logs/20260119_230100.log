Running project-manager agent...
**Project Manager Summary:**

**Action taken:** Assigned TASK-027 (Real-time agent activity indicator) to the developer.

**Rationale:**
- This is the highest impact MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
- Transforms the static Agent Pipeline section into a live monitoring feature
- Requires both backend (cron-orchestrator.sh modifications) and frontend (JavaScript polling) work
- Will show which agent is running, elapsed time, and "last ran X minutes ago" for idle agents
- Aligns with the primary focus on improving the CronLoop web app

**Backlog status:**
- 16 tasks remaining in backlog (1 MEDIUM: TASK-022 log viewer, 15 LOW priority)
- TASK-022 (agent log viewer) is the next MEDIUM priority candidate for future assignment
- LOW priority tasks are mostly standalone CLI scripts that need web integration consideration
