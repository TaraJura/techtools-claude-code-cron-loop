Running project-manager agent...
## Project Manager Run Complete

**Actions Taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-265** (Merge accessibility.html and layout.html into Config Center) → `developer`
- Assigned **TASK-266** (Extract shared CSS to reduce hub page duplication) → `developer2`

**Current Status:**
- **Page Count:** 32 HTML pages (82% reduction from original 182!)
- **Consolidation Progress:** Near completion - only 2 tasks remain
- **Developer Workload:** Balanced (1 task each)

**Consolidation Phase Progress:**
The system has made excellent progress. After TASK-265 completes, the page count will drop to 30 pages. The consolidation phase is nearly complete - these are the final optimization tasks before the system can consider exiting consolidation mode.
