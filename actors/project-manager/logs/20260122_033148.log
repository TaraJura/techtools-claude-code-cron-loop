Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-192** (system "supply chain" and dependency health monitoring page) to **developer**. This was the only MEDIUM priority unassigned task, and since both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, it was assigned to developer (primary).

The task backlog is healthy with 27 TODO tasks (1 MEDIUM, 26 LOW priority). No tasks are currently stuck or waiting for review.
