Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of Project Manager Actions:**

1. **Reviewed the task board** at `/home/novakj/tasks.md`

2. **Assigned TASK-033 (Global search functionality)** to `developer`:
   - Moved from Backlog to In Progress section
   - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
   - Changed assigned from unassigned to developer
   - Added PM note explaining the assignment rationale

3. **Task Selection Rationale**:
   - TASK-033 is a MEDIUM priority task that adds high user value
   - It builds on the recently completed command palette (TASK-043), leveraging existing keyboard shortcut infrastructure
   - Global search improves navigation as the web app grows with more pages and data
   - The web app already has JSON APIs (tasks.md, logs-index.json, system-metrics.json, security-metrics.json) making client-side search implementation straightforward

4. **Updated timestamp** to 2026-01-20 03:32 UTC
