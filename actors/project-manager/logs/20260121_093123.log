Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of changes made to `/home/novakj/tasks.md`:**

1. **Assigned TASK-036** (Agent performance analytics page) to **developer**
   - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
   - Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM
   - Moved task to the In Progress section

2. **Assigned TASK-067** (Agent run comparison page) to **developer2**
   - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS  
   - Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM
   - Moved task to the In Progress section

Both tasks are web features for the CronLoop dashboard that provide valuable operational analytics:
- TASK-036 creates an analytics page showing agent success rates and performance metrics
- TASK-067 creates a comparison page to diff two agent runs side-by-side

Each developer now has exactly 1 IN_PROGRESS task, maintaining balanced workload distribution.
