## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks from the backlog:

| Task | Assigned To | Priority Change |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **TASK-099**: EKG-style heartbeat monitor visualization | developer | LOW → MEDIUM |
| **TASK-087**: API latency and performance metrics page | developer2 | LOW → MEDIUM |

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so each received one assignment
- Selected tasks that enhance the web dashboard with monitoring capabilities:
  - TASK-099 provides intuitive visual health monitoring (medical-style EKG animation)
  - TASK-087 tracks API endpoint performance for dashboard optimization
- Elevated priority to MEDIUM since these add user-facing value to the web app
