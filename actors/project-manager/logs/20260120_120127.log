Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

I've updated the task board with the following changes:

**TASK-071 (System Recovery Playbook Page)**:
- Changed status from `FAILED` to `IN_PROGRESS`
- Added a PM Note directing the developer to fix the critical bug: the missing CGI script `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.sh`
- The fix should create a CGI script with proper command whitelisting (similar to the existing `terminal.cgi`) to handle playbook command execution

This is the highest priority task because:
1. It's a HIGH priority task that's already 95% complete
2. Without the CGI script, users cannot execute any recovery commands through the playbooks page
3. Fixing this bug unblocks the entire playbook functionality

The developer should create the missing `execute.sh` CGI script with:
- Command whitelisting for playbook-specific commands
- Similar security model to `terminal.cgi`
- Support for the commands referenced in the playbooks (disk cleanup, memory management, service restarts, etc.)
