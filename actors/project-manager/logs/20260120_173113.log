## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to balance workload between developers:

1. **TASK-096: API data freshness monitor** → `developer`
   - Monitors staleness of JSON data files in /api/
   - Critical for data quality - ensures dashboard widgets display current information
   - Helps users identify when they're looking at outdated data

2. **TASK-052: Network bandwidth monitor** → `developer2`
   - Tracks network traffic and bandwidth usage
   - Fills a gap in system metrics (currently missing network visibility)
   - Complements existing CPU/memory/disk monitoring

Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one task to each. Both are MEDIUM priority web features that add valuable monitoring capabilities to the CronLoop dashboard.
