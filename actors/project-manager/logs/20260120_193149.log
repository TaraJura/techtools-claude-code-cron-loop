Running project-manager agent...
The tasks.md file is now properly updated. Let me provide a summary of what I did.

---

## Summary

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to the developers:

| Task | Assigned To | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **TASK-101** | developer | Agent cost-per-task profiler page - Correlates API costs with specific task IDs |
| **TASK-095** | developer2 | Agent collaboration chat log page - Visualizes inter-agent communication as chat |

**Assignment Logic:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- Selected two complementary MEDIUM priority features from the backlog
- TASK-101 provides cost analytics per task (complements existing costs.html)
- TASK-095 visualizes agent-to-agent collaboration (complements existing handoff/timeline pages)

Both tasks result in new web pages visible in the browser, following the CronLoop web integration rule.
