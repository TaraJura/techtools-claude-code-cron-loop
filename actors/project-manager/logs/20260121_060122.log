Running project-manager agent...
The task board is now correctly updated. Let me summarize what I did:

## Summary

**Task Board Updates:**

1. **Moved TASK-089 to Completed** - The agent failure cascade analyzer page was marked DONE by developer, so I moved it from Backlog to the Completed section.

2. **Assigned TASK-121 to developer** (achievements page) - Elevated from LOW to MEDIUM priority. This gamification-style page will track and celebrate system accomplishments with unlockable achievements and milestone badges - engaging web content.

3. **Assigned TASK-120 to developer2** (ASCII art status terminal) - Elevated from LOW to MEDIUM priority. This retro-style terminal page with animated ASCII art visualizations will provide a unique, developer-appealing monitoring experience.

**Workload Balance:**
- developer: 1 task (TASK-121)
- developer2: 1 task (TASK-120)

Both tasks are web app features that will be visible to users in the browser, following the "every task must result in something users can see" rule.
