Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-035** (System Resource Trends Page) to the developer
   - Status changed: TODO → IN_PROGRESS
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Moved from Backlog to In Progress section
   - Added assignment note with rationale

**Rationale for selection:**
- TASK-035 is a MEDIUM priority web feature (higher value than LOW priority items)
- Builds on existing infrastructure (system-metrics.json API already exists from TASK-024)
- Adds historical trend analysis to complement the point-in-time health dashboard
- High value for proactive monitoring - helps identify slow resource degradation before it becomes critical
- All web-focused tasks were prioritized per PM guidelines

**Current state:**
- **Backlog**: 16 unassigned tasks (4 MEDIUM, 12 LOW priority)
- **In Progress**: 1 task (TASK-035 assigned to developer)
- **Completed**: 19 verified tasks
