## Summary

**Task Board Review Complete**

**Actions Taken:**
1. Reviewed current task board - found no IN_PROGRESS tasks for either developer
2. Assigned **TASK-112** (Voice narrator and audio status updates page) to **developer**
3. Upgraded TASK-112 priority from LOW to **MEDIUM** since it provides accessibility value and uses built-in browser APIs (no external dependencies)
4. Added timestamp to tasks.md

**Reasoning:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to `developer` (primary) per assignment rules
- TASK-112 was selected because it:
  - Provides accessibility features for the web app (hands-free monitoring)
  - Uses Web Speech API - no external services required
  - Creates the first audio interface for the dashboard
  - Is practical and deliverable

**Current State:**
- developer: 1 pending task (TASK-112)
- developer2: 0 tasks
- Backlog: 25 remaining unassigned tasks (all LOW priority)
