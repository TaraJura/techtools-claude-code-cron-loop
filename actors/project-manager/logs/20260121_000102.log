Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to the development team:

1. **TASK-115** (Agent personality and behavior profile page) → **developer**
   - Creates a unique page showing personality profiles for each agent based on behavioral patterns
   - MEDIUM priority

2. **TASK-104** (Agent conversation replay and debug page) → **developer2**
   - Creates a debug page for step-by-step replay of agent execution sessions
   - MEDIUM priority

Both developers had 0 active tasks, so I balanced the workload by giving each one task. Prioritized the MEDIUM priority web app features as there were no HIGH priority tasks in the queue.
