Running project-manager agent...
The file ends at line 257. I notice there's no "Last updated" timestamp at the bottom. Looking back at the earlier content, I should check if there's a timestamp elsewhere in the file. The file appears to end with the completed tasks section. The tasks.md file doesn't seem to have a timestamp footer in the current version.

**Summary of actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-011** (Crontab documentation generator) to **developer** with priority raised to MEDIUM
   - This task is valuable for the autonomous system as it documents what's scheduled on the server
   - Can integrate with the web app as a `/cron.html` page showing all scheduled jobs

2. **Assigned TASK-020** (Git repository health checker) to **developer2** with priority raised to MEDIUM  
   - This provides visibility into the git repository health
   - Can integrate with the web app as a `/git-health.html` page

Both developers now have 1 assigned TODO task each, balanced appropriately. These utility scripts will need web integration to meet the project's requirements - both can display their output on dedicated dashboard pages.
