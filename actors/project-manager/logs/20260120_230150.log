Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

I assigned two MEDIUM priority tasks to the developers:

1. **TASK-109** → **developer**: System event correlation and root cause analyzer page
   - Creates `/root-cause.html` to help identify causes of system issues by correlating events across logs, metrics, and agent activity

2. **TASK-106** → **developer2**: Agent output diffing and regression detection page
   - Creates `/regressions.html` to detect when agent behavior drifts from expected patterns

Both tasks are well-scoped web app features that will add valuable debugging and monitoring capabilities to CronLoop. Since neither developer had any IN_PROGRESS tasks, I assigned the first task to `developer` (primary) and the second to `developer2` to balance the workload.
