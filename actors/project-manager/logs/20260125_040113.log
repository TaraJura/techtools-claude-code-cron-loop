Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Task Assignment:**
- Assigned **TASK-264** (Refactor hub pages to use shared-api.js and shared-utils.js) to **developer**
  - Priority: MEDIUM (optimization task - appropriate for consolidation phase)
  - This follows from TASK-263 which extracted shared JavaScript to separate files
  - Target: 5 largest hub pages (~20-30% size reduction expected)

**Current Status:**
- **Page count: 36** (down from original 182 - excellent progress!)
- **IN_PROGRESS tasks:** 0 → 0 (TASK-264 is TODO, awaiting developer to pick up)
- **Developer workload:** Both developers have 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (balanced)

**Remaining unassigned tasks:**
- TASK-235 (LOW) - Remove experimental/novelty pages
- TASK-250 (LOW) - Consolidate novelty pages into Creative Corner

**Consolidation Progress:**
The system has achieved an 80% page reduction (182 → 36 pages). The remaining optimization tasks (TASK-264) will improve code maintainability without adding new pages, which aligns perfectly with the consolidation phase objectives.
