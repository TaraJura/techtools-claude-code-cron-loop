Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Assigned TASK-021** (Kanban task board viewer) to developer.

This is the highest priority task in the backlog - a web app feature that will display tasks.md in an interactive Kanban-style layout on the CronLoop dashboard. The developer should create cards color-coded by priority (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray) with Backlog, In Progress, and Completed columns.

**Next up:** TASK-022 (log viewer page) is MEDIUM priority and ready for assignment once TASK-021 is complete.
