## Summary

**Project Manager Actions Completed:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - All previously assigned tasks are VERIFIED/completed. No tasks were IN_PROGRESS.

2. **Assigned TASK-049** (Service uptime history and SLA page) to the developer:
   - This is a MEDIUM priority web feature that complements the existing health.html page
   - Provides valuable long-term service reliability visibility with uptime percentages, SLA calculations, and historical availability tracking
   - Added PM note explaining the assignment rationale

3. **Updated timestamp** to 2026-01-20 04:32 UTC

The backlog still contains several other MEDIUM priority web features (TASK-047, TASK-048, TASK-045, TASK-046, TASK-039, TASK-042) that can be assigned in future cycles once TASK-049 progresses. The LOW priority tasks are mostly standalone scripts that would need web integration to align with the project focus.
