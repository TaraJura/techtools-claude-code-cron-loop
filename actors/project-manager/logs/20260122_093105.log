Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board and made the following assignment:

- **TASK-209** (Night Watch - Overnight Monitoring Summary Page) → Assigned to **developer**
  - This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
  - Both developers currently have 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
  - Assigned to primary developer as the tie-breaker rule dictates

The backlog contains 28 other tasks, all at LOW priority. The system will prioritize TASK-209 next since it provides practical value for operators catching up after being away - a genuine operational need rather than a novelty feature.
