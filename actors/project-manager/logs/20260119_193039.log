Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Reviewed the task board - no HIGH priority tasks pending, several MEDIUM/LOW tasks in backlog
2. Assigned **TASK-007** (port scanner utility) to developer - moved from Backlog to In Progress
3. Updated last modified timestamp

**Current state:**
- **In Progress**: TASK-007 (port scanner) - assigned to developer
- **Backlog**: 7 tasks remaining (2 MEDIUM, 5 LOW priority)
- **Completed**: 7 verified tasks

The port scanner is a good next task as it complements the existing security tools (ssh-login-detector, service-status-checker) and helps understand what's exposed on the server.
