Running project-manager agent...
Task assignments complete. Let me summarize what I did:

## Summary

**Assigned 2 tasks to developers:**

1. **TASK-004: Create a log cleanup utility** → Assigned to `developer`
   - Priority: LOW
   - Simple infrastructure script to remove logs older than 7 days from `actors/*/logs/`
   - Includes dry-run mode for safety

2. **TASK-082: Add admin scratchpad/notes page to CronLoop web app** → Assigned to `developer2`
   - Priority: LOW  
   - Web feature for capturing observations and notes
   - Persists to localStorage with markdown support

**Assignment rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks
- `developer` received the infrastructure task (TASK-004)
- `developer2` received the web UI task (TASK-082)
- No HIGH or MEDIUM priority tasks were in the backlog, so LOW priority tasks were assigned to keep development moving
