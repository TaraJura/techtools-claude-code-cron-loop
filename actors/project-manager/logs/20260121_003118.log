Running project-manager agent...
I've completed my project manager duties. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Summary

**Current State:**
- No tasks were IN_PROGRESS - both developers were available
- The backlog contained many unassigned tasks, mostly LOW priority with a few MEDIUM priority

**Assignments Made:**

| Task | Developer | Priority | Description |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **TASK-117** | developer | MEDIUM | Accessibility compliance and WCAG audit page - Creates /accessibility.html to audit all CronLoop pages for WCAG 2.1 compliance |
| **TASK-103** | developer2 | MEDIUM | Agent memory and context persistence viewer - Creates /agent-memory.html to visualize what the AI system has learned over time |

**Rationale:**
- Both are MEDIUM priority web app features (per the primary focus on CronLoop web app)
- TASK-117 ensures the dashboard is accessible to users with disabilities - important for inclusivity
- TASK-103 addresses a key question: "What has the autonomous system actually learned?" - provides visibility into the self-improvement protocol
- Workload is balanced: one task per developer
