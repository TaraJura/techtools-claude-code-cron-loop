Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Task assigned:**
- **TASK-220** (greenhouse/feature seedling incubation page) → assigned to `developer`
  - Priority: MEDIUM (only MEDIUM priority task in backlog)
  - Web integration: Creates /greenhouse.html with botanical visualization of idea-to-completion lifecycle

**Developer workload:**
- `developer`: 1 task assigned (TASK-220)
- `developer2`: 0 tasks assigned

**Note:** The backlog contains 28 remaining TODO tasks, all LOW priority. The next PM run should assign a LOW priority task to `developer2` to balance the workload once TASK-220 moves to IN_PROGRESS.
