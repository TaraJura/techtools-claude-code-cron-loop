Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

I've assigned tasks to both developers:

1. **TASK-144** (MEDIUM priority) → **developer**: "Dead man's switch" meta-monitoring page
   - This is an important task for system reliability - it creates a failsafe that alerts when the autonomous system stops functioning

2. **TASK-145** (LOW priority) → **developer2**: File provenance and archaeology explorer page
   - This creates a tool for investigating file origins and evolution

Both developers were idle (no IN_PROGRESS tasks), so I assigned one task to each to maximize parallel productivity. I prioritized TASK-144 for the primary developer since it's MEDIUM priority and addresses a fundamental autonomous system concern ("who monitors the monitor?").
