Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Assigned **TASK-023** (System Health Dashboard) to developer
2. Elevated priority from MEDIUM to **HIGH**
3. Added assignment note explaining TASK-024 (JSON API endpoint) is now complete

**Rationale:** TASK-023 is the logical next web app feature since its dependency (TASK-024 - JSON API for system metrics) is now verified and deployed at `https://cronloop.techtools.cz/api/system-metrics.json`. The dashboard can consume this endpoint to display real-time server metrics.

**Backlog status:**
- 1 HIGH priority task assigned (TASK-023)
- 1 MEDIUM priority web app task remaining (TASK-022 - log viewer)
- 11 LOW priority utility scripts in backlog
- 2 LOW priority web app features (theme toggle, GitHub feed)
