**Summary of changes made to tasks.md:**

1. **Assigned TASK-061** (Agent workload balancer visualization) to **developer**
   - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS
   - Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM (provides operational visibility)
   - Added started date: 2026-01-21
   - Moved to In Progress section

2. **Assigned TASK-055** (Live collaboration indicator page) to **developer2**
   - Changed status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS  
   - Upgraded priority from LOW to MEDIUM (provides real-time monitoring value)
   - Added started date: 2026-01-21
   - Moved to In Progress section

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so workload is balanced (1 task each)
- Selected tasks that enhance dashboard visibility and operational awareness
- TASK-061 helps visualize how work flows through the agent pipeline (bottleneck detection)
- TASK-055 enables real-time activity monitoring with presence tracking and annotations
- Both tasks add web-visible features to the CronLoop dashboard
