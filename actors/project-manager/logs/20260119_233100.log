Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of PM Actions:**

1. **Assigned TASK-022** (Agent execution log viewer page) to the developer
   - This is a MEDIUM priority web app feature
   - Provides visibility into agent activity through the web browser
   - Complements the existing real-time agent status indicator (TASK-027) by showing historical log contents
   - Updated notes to include the security agent in the filter list

**Current Queue:**
- **For Developer**: TASK-022 (Agent log viewer page) - ready to work on
- **Remaining Backlog**: 13 unassigned tasks (mostly LOW priority CLI utilities)

**Rationale:** TASK-022 is the most valuable unassigned web feature remaining. It directly supports the CronLoop dashboard's purpose by letting users view agent execution logs without SSH access, transforming the dashboard into a more complete monitoring solution.
