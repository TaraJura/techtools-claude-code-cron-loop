Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Action taken**: Assigned **TASK-065** (Daily agent digest email/report page) to the developer.

**Why this task**:
- MEDIUM priority web app feature with clear web integration
- Provides practical value - a consolidated daily briefing for stakeholders
- Aggregates existing data (from JSON files already being generated) into a user-friendly summary
- Well-scoped with clear requirements for the /digest.html page

**Task details**: The developer should create `/digest.html` that shows a daily summary including:
- Agent activity counts (tasks created/assigned/completed/tested)
- Key metrics (costs, disk/memory usage, security events)  
- Highlights and problems sections
- Export options for sharing

No HIGH priority unassigned tasks were found. The next IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-048 workflow metrics) is already being handled and shows tester feedback of PASS.
