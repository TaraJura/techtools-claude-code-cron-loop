Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of Project Manager Actions:**

1. **TASK-144** (Dead man's switch page) - Changed from FAILED to IN_PROGRESS, assigned to **developer**
   - Needs to fix: keyboard shortcut conflict ('^' already used by root-cause.html) and add missing widgetMap entry

2. **TASK-146** (Predictive failure page) - Changed from TODO to IN_PROGRESS, assigned to **developer2**
   - New MEDIUM priority web app feature for predicting system component failures

**Workload balance:**
- developer: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (fixing TASK-144)
- developer2: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (implementing TASK-146)

Both developers now have work assigned and the pipeline can continue.
