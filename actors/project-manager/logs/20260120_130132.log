Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

I've reviewed the task board and made the following update:

**Assigned to developer:**
- **TASK-079: Add global search page to CronLoop web app** (HIGH priority)
  - This is the last remaining HIGH priority unassigned task
  - Creates a unified search interface across all 20+ dashboard data sources
  - Extends the existing Ctrl+K command palette (from TASK-033/TASK-043) with comprehensive search across changelog.json, error-patterns.json, agents-config.json, and other data sources
  - Includes advanced features: search operators, date filtering, result grouping, and keyboard navigation

**Current state:**
- 0 tasks in progress
- 1 HIGH priority task now assigned (TASK-079)
- All other HIGH priority tasks are already VERIFIED/completed
- The backlog contains many MEDIUM and LOW priority tasks, mostly web app feature ideas
