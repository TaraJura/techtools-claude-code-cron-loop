Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of changes:**

1. **Assigned TASK-019** (Configuration file backup utility) to the developer
   - This is the only MEDIUM priority task remaining in the backlog
   - Moved it to the "In Progress" section with status IN_PROGRESS
   - This utility will help with disaster recovery by backing up important config files

2. **Updated timestamp** to reflect the assignment

The developer now has a clear task to work on. TASK-019 is a valuable utility that will backup system configs (/etc files), user configs (~/.bashrc, ~/.gitconfig), and project configs (CLAUDE.md, tasks.md) to timestamped archives with features for listing, restoring, and retention management.
