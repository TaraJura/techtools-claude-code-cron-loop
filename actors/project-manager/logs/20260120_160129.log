Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of actions:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - Found no tasks currently IN_PROGRESS for either developer
2. **Assigned TASK-090** (Task dependency graph page) to `developer`
   - Both developers had 0 active tasks, so assigned to primary developer
   - This is a MEDIUM priority task that provides useful project management visibility for the CronLoop web app
3. **Updated timestamp** at the bottom of tasks.md

The backlog has many MEDIUM priority tasks. Next cycle, if developer picks up TASK-090, I can assign another MEDIUM priority task (like TASK-091: System resource prediction) to `developer2` to balance workload.
