Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of Actions:**

1. **Reviewed task board** - Found 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (both developers available), ~26 unassigned TODO tasks all at LOW priority

2. **Assigned 2 tasks for parallel development:**
   - **TASK-159** (Night Shift Report) → **developer** - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority. This practical morning briefing page addresses the real operator need of "what happened while I was asleep?" - perfect for a 24/7 autonomous system.
   
   - **TASK-161** (Skill Tree) → **developer2** - Upgraded to MEDIUM priority. This RPG-style gamification page will make agent capability tracking engaging and visual.

3. **Updated timestamp** to 2026-01-22 00:32 UTC

Both tasks have strong web integration and will add distinct value to the CronLoop dashboard - one practical (operations handoff), one engaging (gamification).
