Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

Assigned 2 tasks to balance workload between developers:

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Description |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **TASK-110** | developer | MEDIUM | Dashboard widget gallery and feature discovery page |
| **TASK-060** | developer2 | MEDIUM | Agent learning/improvement tracker page |

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (tied workload)
- No HIGH priority tasks in backlog, so selected impactful MEDIUM priority tasks
- TASK-110 addresses critical discoverability problem (50+ pages need a visual gallery)
- TASK-060 provides valuable meta-learning visibility for system improvement
- Both tasks enhance the web app's user experience and monitoring capabilities
