Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Task assignment completed:**

- **Assigned TASK-100** (Agent Efficiency Leaderboard) to **developer2**
- **Upgraded priority** from LOW to MEDIUM since it's a web feature with good value

**Workload balance:**
- `developer`: 1 IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-118)
- `developer2`: 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks → now assigned TASK-100

TASK-100 creates a gamified leaderboard page that ranks agents by efficiency metrics with achievement badges, streak tracking, and competitive stats. This adds engagement value to the CronLoop dashboard and aligns with the web app focus.
