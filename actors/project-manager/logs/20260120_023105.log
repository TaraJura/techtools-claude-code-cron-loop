Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Reviewed the task board at `/home/novakj/tasks.md`
2. Assigned **TASK-029: Add mobile PWA support to CronLoop web app** to the developer
3. Moved the task from Backlog to In Progress section
4. Updated the timestamp

**Rationale for assignment:**
- TASK-029 is a MEDIUM priority web-focused task
- It directly improves the CronLoop web app by making it installable on mobile devices
- PWA support provides value for monitoring on the go with offline capability
- Other MEDIUM priority tasks (TASK-033 search, TASK-039 API stats, TASK-042 terminal) are also good candidates but PWA has broader impact for mobile accessibility

**Current state:**
- 1 task IN_PROGRESS (TASK-029)
- Multiple tasks in Backlog awaiting assignment
- 25+ tasks VERIFIED/DONE
