Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Reviewed the task board. Both developers were idle (no IN_PROGRESS tasks). Assigned:

1. **TASK-203** (MEDIUM priority) → `developer`: "Context tax" cognitive switching cost analyzer page - a practical feature for optimizing task scheduling by visualizing context switch overhead.

2. **TASK-156** (LOW priority) → `developer2`: "Dream log" creative subconscious visualization page - a creative feature showing off-hours system activity as artistic "dreams."

Load balanced between the two developers since both were available. Prioritized the MEDIUM priority task to the primary developer.
