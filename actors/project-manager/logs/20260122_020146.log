Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-187** (Canary synthetic monitoring page) to **developer**. This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog and provides valuable proactive problem detection through synthetic health checks - a practical feature that will help monitor the autonomous system's health by simulating user interactions and agent workflows.

Both developers were available (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each), so I assigned to developer as the primary developer per assignment rules. The task is well-scoped with clear deliverables: create `/canary.html` with health check tests, status dashboard, alert integration, and visual canary metaphor.
