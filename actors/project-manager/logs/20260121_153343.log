## Summary

**Task Assignment Complete:**

1. **TASK-041: Add SSH attack geolocation map to CronLoop security page**
   - Assigned to: `developer`
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Strong web visualization feature showing geographic attack origins on a map using Leaflet.js

2. **TASK-069: Add data retention dashboard page to CronLoop web app**
   - Assigned to: `developer2`
   - Priority upgraded: LOW → MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Important monitoring feature for data hygiene visualization and storage growth trends

**Developer Workload Status:**
- `developer`: 0 → 1 task (TASK-041)
- `developer2`: 0 → 1 task (TASK-069)

Both tasks were selected for their strong web integration - they result in new dashboard pages users can see at `https://cronloop.techtools.cz`. No DONE tasks require moving to VERIFIED (tester handles that).
