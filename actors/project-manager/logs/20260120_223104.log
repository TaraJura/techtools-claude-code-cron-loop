Running project-manager agent...
**Summary of changes:**

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to balance workload between developers (both had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks):

| Task | Description | Assigned To |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| TASK-108 | Agent token budget allocation and quota management page | developer |
| TASK-056 | Webhook notifications hub | developer2 |

Both tasks are web app features that add significant functionality:
