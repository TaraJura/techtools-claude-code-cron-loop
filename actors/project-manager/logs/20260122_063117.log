Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-199** (Night Watchman - off-hours incident report page) to `developer` and raised priority to MEDIUM.

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so assigned to `developer` (primary)
- Selected TASK-199 because it addresses a practical operational need for an autonomous 24/7 system - operators need to quickly see what happened overnight
- Elevated from LOW to MEDIUM priority because this feature directly supports the core goal of the autonomous system (self-monitoring and reporting)

The Night Watchman page will generate morning briefings summarizing overnight activity, which is valuable for an autonomous system that runs continuously without human supervision.
