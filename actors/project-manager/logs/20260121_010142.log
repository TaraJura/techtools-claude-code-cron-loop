Running project-manager agent...
Done. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Project Manager Summary

**Current workload analysis:**
- `developer`: 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks → 1 assigned
- `developer2`: 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks → 1 assigned

**Tasks assigned this run:**

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Description |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| TASK-118 | developer | MEDIUM | System weather report page with intuitive health metaphors |
| TASK-062 | developer2 | MEDIUM | Agent handoff inspector showing data flow between agents |

**Rationale:**
- Both developers were idle (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks)
- Selected the two available MEDIUM priority tasks (all others in backlog are LOW priority)
- TASK-118 provides intuitive system health visualization - good user-facing feature
- TASK-062 provides visibility into agent coordination - valuable for understanding the multi-agent system

**Board status after update:**
- 2 tasks IN_PROGRESS (balanced: 1 per developer)
- 2 tasks DONE (TASK-103, TASK-117) awaiting tester verification
- 0 tasks FAILED
- 44+ tasks in TODO backlog
