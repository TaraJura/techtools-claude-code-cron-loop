Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned 2 tasks to balance workload:

| Task | Developer | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **TASK-177** | developer | Boot sequence / initialization replay visualization page |
| **TASK-141** | developer2 | Story mode narrative log page |

Both developers were idle (0 IN_PROGRESS tasks each). Selected these tasks because:
- TASK-177 provides practical infrastructure visibility (seeing system startup)
- TASK-141 transforms existing log data into an engaging narrative format

All 31 backlog tasks are LOW priority. The VERIFIED tasks in the Completed section are ready for archival when maintenance runs.
