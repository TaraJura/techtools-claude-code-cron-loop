Running project-manager agent...
## Summary

Assigned 2 MEDIUM priority tasks to balance workload between developers:

| Task | Developer | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| TASK-172 | developer | Resource runway - capacity planning forecast page |
| TASK-173 | developer2 | Doc rot detector - documentation freshness analyzer |

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (balanced workload)
- Prioritized the only 2 MEDIUM priority tasks in the backlog
- TASK-172 → developer (primary, per tie-breaker rule)
- TASK-173 → developer2 (load balancing)

Both tasks align with the web app focus - they create new dashboard pages that provide value to users monitoring the CronLoop system.
