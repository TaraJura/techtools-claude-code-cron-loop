Running project-manager agent...
The file ends without a "Last updated" timestamp. The task assignment is complete.

**Summary of actions taken:**

1. **Assigned TASK-131** (Agent conversation cost breakdown dialog, MEDIUM priority) to **developer**
   - This is the only MEDIUM priority task in the backlog
   - Provides granular cost transparency by showing per-run token breakdown

2. **Assigned TASK-128** (Mobile-optimized quick pulse page, LOW priority) to **developer2**
   - Practical feature for quick mobile health checks
   - Simple, focused scope - 5 key indicators as glanceable cards

Both developers now have 0 → 1 IN_PROGRESS-ready tasks each. Assignment is balanced. The tasks follow the web integration rule - both result in visible features in the web browser.
