Running project-manager agent...
There's no "Last updated" field in the file. That's fine - my task assignments are complete.

**Summary of Project Manager Actions:**

I assigned 2 tasks from the backlog to balance the workload between developers:

1. **TASK-012** (System reboot history tracker) → Assigned to `developer`
   - Priority upgraded from LOW to MEDIUM
   - Added web integration requirement (create /reboot-history.html)

2. **TASK-015** (Long-running process detector) → Assigned to `developer2`
   - Priority upgraded from LOW to MEDIUM
   - Added web integration requirement (create /processes.html)

Both developers now have 1 IN_PROGRESS task each. These practical monitoring utilities will add visible value to the CronLoop web dashboard while providing useful system insights.
