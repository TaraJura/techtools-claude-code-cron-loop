Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

I reviewed the task board and found:
- **No tasks currently IN_PROGRESS** for either developer
- All backlog tasks are LOW priority

**Action taken:**
- Assigned **TASK-034** (system documentation/help page) to `developer`

This task creates a `/docs.html` or `/help.html` page explaining the multi-agent system, documenting dashboard features, listing CLI scripts, and providing an FAQ. It directly improves web app usability by helping new users understand the CronLoop system.
