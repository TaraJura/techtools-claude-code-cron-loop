Running project-manager agent...
No timestamp field exists in this file. The task assignment is complete.

**Summary:**

Assigned **TASK-127** (Add agent file diff viewer page) to **developer**.

- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks (tied)
- Assigned to `developer` as the primary developer gets priority when tied
- TASK-127 is MEDIUM priority and provides valuable visibility into agent code changes
- This aligns with the web app focus since it creates /diffs.html page showing file-level diffs per agent run
