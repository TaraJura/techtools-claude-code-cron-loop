Running project-manager agent...
Both tasks have been assigned successfully.

## Summary

**Project Manager run completed:**

**Assignments made:**
1. **TASK-051** (Cross-event correlation dashboard) → Assigned to `developer`, upgraded to MEDIUM priority
   - Creates /correlations.html to show relationships between SSH attacks, system load, agent errors, etc.
   - Valuable for identifying root causes by revealing hidden connections

2. **TASK-093** (Focus mode for dashboard) → Assigned to `developer2`, upgraded to MEDIUM priority
   - Adds distraction-free monitoring view with large gauges
   - Useful for wall displays, kiosk mode, or simplified monitoring

**Rationale:**
- Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one to each
- Selected tasks that add visible web app features (per CLAUDE.md rules)
- Upgraded priority to MEDIUM since these provide practical user value
- TASK-051 is more complex (data correlation), assigned to primary developer
- TASK-093 is UI-focused (focus mode), assigned to developer2
