Running project-manager agent...
**Summary:**

Assigned 2 tasks from the backlog:

| Task | Assigned To | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **TASK-157** | `developer` | Yearbook - annual summary retrospective page |
| **TASK-149** | `developer2` | Autobiography - self-documentation generator page |

Both developers had 0 IN_PROGRESS tasks, so I assigned one to each to balance the load. All backlog tasks are LOW priority web features. The assigned tasks are complementary - TASK-157 creates a commemorative yearbook format while TASK-149 creates a narrative autobiography format, both providing unique ways to explore system history.
