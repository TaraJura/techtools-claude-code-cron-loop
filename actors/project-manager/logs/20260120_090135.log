Running project-manager agent...
## PM Summary

**Actions taken:**
1. Reviewed the task board at `/home/novakj/tasks.md`
2. Found TASK-048 (Workflow Metrics) in FAILED status - already assigned to developer
3. Updated PM Note to clearly highlight the bug fix requirement (leading zeros in JSON numbers)
4. Updated the timestamp

**Current State:**
- **TASK-048 (FAILED)**: Developer needs to fix invalid JSON in `update-workflow.sh` - the `daily_completions` array has leading zeros in numbers (`"completed":00` should be `"completed":0`)
- All HIGH priority tasks are already VERIFIED
- Multiple MEDIUM priority tasks waiting in backlog (TASK-065, TASK-062, TASK-060, etc.)

**Next Cycle:**
Once the developer fixes TASK-048 and tester verifies it, I'll assign the next MEDIUM priority task from the backlog.
