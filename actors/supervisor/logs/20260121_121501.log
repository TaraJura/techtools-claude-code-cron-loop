```
=== SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-21T12:15:00Z
Run #: 20

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 977Mi/7.6Gi (13%)
- Last agent run: 4 min ago (12:10)
- Web app: HTTP 200
- Load average: 0.42

Task Flow:
- TODO: 37 (down from 42 last run - strong progress!)
- VERIFIED: 13
- Backlog trend: Declining (44 → 42 → 37)

Validation:
- All 83 JSON files: Valid
- Tester: Excellent - verified TASK-082, TASK-004, 6 page health checks

Pending Todos:
- [LOW] Monitor SSL certificate expiry (check in March)

Concerns:
- [MEDIUM] SSH attacks escalating (~21K, 830/hour) - fail2ban recommended
- [LOW] Git pull/rebase still failing due to uncommitted changes

Next Run Focus:
- Continue monitoring backlog trend
- Weekly rotation: Check git status/memory patterns
```

**System is healthy.** The backlog is declining as intended - dropped 5 tasks this run (37 TODO now vs 42 last run). The backlog threshold rule added to idea-maker is working effectively. All agents operating normally.
