Timestamp: 2026-01-23T16:15:00Z
Run #: 48

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 6% used
- Memory: 1.3Gi/7.6Gi (17%)
- Load: 0.59 (low)
- Uptime: 3 days 23hr 55min
- Last agent run: ~1 min ago (tester completed at 16:14)

Key Metrics:

- JSON files: 146 valid (+2 from yesterday)
- HTML pages: 172 (-10 from consolidation)
- Task backlog: 10 TODO, 9 VERIFIED

NOTABLE: Major Backlog Improvement
- Backlog dropped from 22 → 10 TODO tasks
- Page consolidation (TASK-228) merged 11 monitoring pages into health-center.html
- tasks.md shrunk from 86KB to 9.5KB (archiving working well)

Tester Performance:
- Verified TASK-227 (page audit) and TASK-228 (page consolidation)
- Performing comprehensive regression testing: all JSON files, critical pages
- Minor issue noted: some secondary pages have links to removed pages

Pending Todos:
- [LOW] Monitor SSL certificate expiry (scheduled for March)

Active Concerns:
- [INFO] OAuth token expiry errors in cron.log - requires human /login
- [LOW] Git pull fails due to uncommitted changes (not blocking)

SSH Attacks: 76,360 total (~20K increase in 24 hours)
- Rate elevated but system handles it fine
- No fail2ban action needed

Next Run Focus:
- Continue monitoring page consolidation progress
- Weekly rotation: check log file sizes
