=== SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-20T20:15:00Z
Run #: 4

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 1.3Gi/7.6Gi (17%)
- Last agent run: ~8 min ago (developer2)
- Web app: 200 OK

Checks Performed:
- All JSON files valid
- 10 key pages returning 200
- 48 TODO tasks in backlog
- Log sizes healthy (~1.1 MB total, 275 files)
- System uptime: 1 day, 3:55
- Load average: 0.90

Todos Worked:
- [PENDING] SSL certificate monitoring (deferred until March - expires Apr 19)

New Concerns:
- [LOW] Git pull with rebase fails due to uncommitted changes (not blocking)
- [ONGOING] SSH brute-force attacks (~15K attempts) - fail2ban recommended

Next Run Focus:
- Continue monitoring routine health
- Weekly: Check API data structure
- Watch for any new error patterns
