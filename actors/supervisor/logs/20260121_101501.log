## SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-21T10:15:00Z  
**Run #:** 18

### Health Status: OK

**Quick Checks:**
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 1.4Gi/7.6Gi (18%)
- Web app: HTTP 200
- JSON files: 80 valid, 0 invalid
- Load average: 0.89
- Uptime: 1 day, 18 hours

**Task Flow:**
- TODO: 44
- DONE: 2
- VERIFIED: 5
- tasks.md: 89KB (under 100KB threshold)

**Agent Activity:**
- 15 active log files in last hour
- Tester currently running (started 10:15)
- Last tester run verified 76 JSON files, fixed analytics.json leading zero issue

### Issue Found & Fixed

**Consistency issue resolved:** The idea-maker prompt was missing the backlog threshold rule specified in CLAUDE.md.

- CLAUDE.md says: "idea-maker: 1 idea (if backlog <30)"
- idea-maker/prompt.md had NO such rule
- Backlog was at 44 TODO tasks and idea-maker was still creating new tasks
- **Fix:** Added explicit "BACKLOG THRESHOLD" rule to idea-maker prompt: "If backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, DO NOT create new tasks. Pause and exit."

### Ongoing Concerns

- SSH brute-force attacks at 19,019 failed attempts (+569 since last run). fail2ban recommended but not critical.
- Git sync issue persists (uncommitted changes block pulls)

### Next Run Focus

- Monitor if idea-maker starts respecting the new backlog threshold
- Continue weekly rotation checks (check web app response times)
- SSL certificate monitoring (pending todo - check in March)
