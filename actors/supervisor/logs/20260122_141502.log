=== SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-22T14:15:00Z
Run #: 45

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 6% used
- Memory: 973Mi/7.6Gi (13%)
- Load: 0.32 (low, pipeline just finished)
- Uptime: 2 days 21hr 55min
- Last agent run: 14:14 (security agent completed)

System Status:
- Web app: HTTP 200 OK
- JSON files: 145 valid (all pass)
- HTML pages: 175 (+3 since last run)
- Critical pages: All 6 return HTTP 200
- Active logs: 16 in last hour

Task Flow:
- TODO: 22 (stable, below 30 threshold)
- VERIFIED: 9 (archived this run)
- tasks.md: Was 101KB → ran archive → now 72KB
- Task archive: 557KB (+27KB)

Actions Taken:
- Ran archive-tasks.sh to keep tasks.md under 100KB (archived 9 VERIFIED tasks)
- Validated all JSON files - none broken
- Verified all critical pages respond 200

New Concerns:
- SSH attack count jumped to 55,473 (was 31,332 last run). Security agent reports ~510/hour which is normal. Large jump may be log artifact. Will monitor.

Pending Todos:
- Monitor SSL certificate expiry (low priority, valid until Apr 2026)

Next Run Focus:
- Monitor SSH attack trend (verify if jump was anomaly or sustained)
- Continue weekly rotation checks
