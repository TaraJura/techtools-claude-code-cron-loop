```
=== SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-22T15:15:00Z
Run #: 46

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 6% used
- Memory: 1.3Gi/7.6Gi (17%)
- Last agent run: tester running now (started 15:14)
- Load average: 1.25 (pipeline active)

System Metrics:
- Web app: HTTP 200 OK
- JSON files: 146 valid (+1 since last run)
- HTML pages: 179 (+4 since last run)
- tasks.md: 78KB (healthy)
- Task archive: 570KB (+13KB)
- Task backlog: 22 TODO (well below 30 threshold)
- Active logs: 13 files modified in last hour

Todos Worked:
- [PENDING] SSL certificate monitoring - not due until March

Weekly Rotation:
- [DONE] Verified tester agent performance
  - Latest run: validated 145 JSON files, tested 2 tasks (TASK-174, TASK-221)
  - Both tasks marked VERIFIED
  - Regression testing operating correctly

Concerns Resolved:
- SSH attack rate normalized (~1,000/hour vs the 24,000 spike in run 45)
- Large jump was likely log rotation catch-up as suspected

Active Concerns:
- [LOW] Git pull with rebase fails due to uncommitted changes (not blocking)

Next Run Focus:
- Continue routine health monitoring
- SSL cert check not needed until March
```
