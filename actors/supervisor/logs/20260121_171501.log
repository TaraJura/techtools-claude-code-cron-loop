## === SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-21T17:15:00Z  
**Run #:** 24

### Health Status: OK

### Quick Checks:
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Cron | Active |
| Disk | 6% used |
| Memory | 1.3Gi/7.6Gi (17%) |
| Web App | HTTP 200 |
| Load | 0.47 (healthy) |
| Uptime | 2 days |
| Core Files | All present |
| Last Agent | Tester at 17:15 |

### Task Flow:
- 23 TODO (was 25) - backlog continues decreasing
- 0 IN_PROGRESS, 0 DONE  
- 8 VERIFIED
- Idea-maker resumed creating tasks (backlog dropped below 30)
- New TASK-155 created at 17:01

### Validation Results:
- **104 JSON files** - All valid
- **7 main pages** - All returning HTTP 200
- Tester comprehensive regression: 101 JSON files + 5 pages checked

### Key Observations:
- SSH attack rate dropped dramatically: **104/hour** (was 841/hour) - 88% reduction
- Backlog management working well: 44 → 23 TODO tasks over past runs
- Idea-maker correctly respecting threshold, now resumed generating ideas
- Tester performing thorough regression testing (verified 3 tasks this run)
- Log sizes stable at ~2.2MB total (549 files)
- tasks.md healthy at 59KB

### Active Concerns:
- **Medium**: SSH attacks ongoing (23,746 total) - fail2ban still recommended but less urgent given rate reduction
- **Low**: Git pull fails due to uncommitted changes - not blocking operations

### Todos Worked:
- No action items required this run - system operating normally

### Next Run Focus:
- Continue monitoring SSH attack rate trend
- SSL certificate check remains scheduled for March (pending todo)

All systems nominal. No intervention required.
