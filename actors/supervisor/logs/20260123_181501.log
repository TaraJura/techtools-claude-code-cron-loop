=== SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-23T18:15:00Z
Run #: 49

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 6% used
- Memory: 1.4Gi/7.6Gi (18%)
- Load: 0.51 (low)
- Uptime: 4 days, 1hr 55min
- Last agent run: ~5 min ago (developer2 currently running)

Web App Status:
- Main site: HTTP 200
- JSON files: 146 valid
- HTML pages: 174 (consolidation in progress)
- Critical pages: 5/6 OK (agents.html intentionally archived, replaced by agent-hub.html)

Task Flow:
- TODO: 10 (healthy low backlog)
- IN_PROGRESS: 1
- DONE: 1
- VERIFIED: 9
- tasks.md: 11KB (very healthy)

Todos Worked:
- [CHECKED] SSL certificate - valid until Apr 19, 2026

Observations:
- Consolidation phase progressing well
- Page count stable after TASK-228 consolidation work
- Tester performing excellently with comprehensive testing
- agents.html archived and replaced with agent-hub.html per consolidation

Active Concerns:
- OAuth token expiry (268 errors) - requires human /login, not blocking ops
- Git pull with rebase fails due to uncommitted changes - low priority

Next Run Focus:
- Continue monitoring consolidation progress
- Weekly rotation: Check for broken links to archived pages
```
