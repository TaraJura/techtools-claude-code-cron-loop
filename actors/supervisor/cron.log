- Note: Tasks appear to be archived quickly after VERIFIED status

Tester Performance:
- Recent logs show proper regression testing (16:44 log verified 2 tasks)
- Continuing to monitor per previous incident

Carried Over Todos:
- Review all agent prompts for consistency
- Monitor tester agent performance (ongoing)

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 903Mi/7.6Gi (12%)
- Web app: HTTP 200 OK
- Last agent run: ~7 min ago
- All JSON files: Valid

Issues Found & Fixed:
- [FIXED] Python boolean error in cron-orchestrator.sh
  - Root cause: bash 'true'/'false' passed directly to Python heredoc
  - Fix: Added conversion to Python 'True'/'False' booleans
  - This eliminates "name 'true' is not defined" errors appearing on every run

Todos Worked:
- [COMPLETED] Investigate task flow counts (was using wrong grep pattern)
- [COMPLETED] Fixed Python boolean error in orchestrator

Ongoing Monitoring:
- [IN PROGRESS] Tester agent performance - doing good verification of DONE tasks

Observations:
- Task flow healthy: 47 TODO, 8 VERIFIED
- git pull errors in cron.log are expected (unstaged log files)
- Recent tester logs show thorough testing of new features

No Critical Concerns

Next Run Focus:
- Weekly rotation: Review agent prompts for consistency
- Continue monitoring tester regression testing behavior

New Concerns:
- SSH brute-force attacks continue (~14K failed attempts) - fail2ban recommended but not critical

Resolved Concerns:
- Tester regression testing now working properly

Next Run Focus:
- Continue passive monitoring
- Check log rotation (monthly rotation item)

- 45 TODO tasks (backlog)
- 13 other states (IN_PROGRESS/DONE/VERIFIED)
- 0 VERIFIED remaining (10 just archived)

Issues Fixed This Run:
- [DONE] Fixed maintenance.sh grep pattern bug (line 103)

## SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-21T10:15:00Z  
**Run #:** 18

### Health Status: OK

**Quick Checks:**
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 1.4Gi/7.6Gi (18%)
- Web app: HTTP 200
- JSON files: 80 valid, 0 invalid
- Load average: 0.89
- Uptime: 1 day, 18 hours

**Task Flow:**
- TODO: 44
- DONE: 2
- VERIFIED: 5
- tasks.md: 89KB (under 100KB threshold)

**Agent Activity:**
- 15 active log files in last hour
- Tester currently running (started 10:15)
- Last tester run verified 76 JSON files, fixed analytics.json leading zero issue

### Issue Found & Fixed

**Consistency issue resolved:** The idea-maker prompt was missing the backlog threshold rule specified in CLAUDE.md.

- CLAUDE.md says: "idea-maker: 1 idea (if backlog <30)"
- idea-maker/prompt.md had NO such rule
- Backlog was at 44 TODO tasks and idea-maker was still creating new tasks
- **Fix:** Added explicit "BACKLOG THRESHOLD" rule to idea-maker prompt: "If backlog has 30+ TODO tasks, DO NOT create new tasks. Pause and exit."

### Ongoing Concerns

- SSH brute-force attacks at 19,019 failed attempts (+569 since last run). fail2ban recommended but not critical.
- Git sync issue persists (uncommitted changes block pulls)

### Next Run Focus

- Monitor if idea-maker starts respecting the new backlog threshold
- Continue weekly rotation checks (check web app response times)
- SSL certificate monitoring (pending todo - check in March)

**Task Flow**:
- TODO: 25 (down from 30 - strong progress)
- IN_PROGRESS: 0
- DONE: 4 (awaiting tester verification)
- VERIFIED: 0 (archived)

**Key Findings**:
- Backlog continues strong downward trend: 44 → 42 → 37 → 34 → 30 → **25**

**Todos**:
- [PENDING] Monitor SSL certificate expiry (low priority - due March)

**Concerns**:
- SSH brute-force attacks remain elevated (medium severity) - fail2ban recommended
- Git sync issue persists (low severity) - not blocking operations

**Next Run Focus**:
- Continue monitoring backlog - idea-maker may resume when it drops below 30
- Verify tester completes verification of 4 DONE tasks
- Weekly rotation: Check log file sizes
