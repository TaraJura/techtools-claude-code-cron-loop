Tester Performance:
- Recent logs show proper regression testing (16:44 log verified 2 tasks)
- Continuing to monitor per previous incident

Carried Over Todos:

=== SUPERVISOR RUN COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-20T18:15:00Z
Run #: 2

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 903Mi/7.6Gi (12%)
- Web app: HTTP 200 OK
- Last agent run: ~7 min ago
- All JSON files: Valid

Issues Found & Fixed:
- [FIXED] Python boolean error in cron-orchestrator.sh
  - Root cause: bash 'true'/'false' passed directly to Python heredoc
  - Fix: Added conversion to Python 'True'/'False' booleans
  - This eliminates "name 'true' is not defined" errors appearing on every run

Todos Worked:
- [COMPLETED] Investigate task flow counts (was using wrong grep pattern)
- [COMPLETED] Fixed Python boolean error in orchestrator

Ongoing Monitoring:
- [IN PROGRESS] Tester agent performance - doing good verification of DONE tasks

Observations:
- Task flow healthy: 47 TODO, 8 VERIFIED
- git pull errors in cron.log are expected (unstaged log files)
- Recent tester logs show thorough testing of new features

No Critical Concerns

Next Run Focus:
- Weekly rotation: Review agent prompts for consistency
- Continue monitoring tester regression testing behavior

- Memory: 1.3Gi/7.6Gi (17%)
- Web app: 200 OK
- Last agent run: ~25 min ago
- Core files: All present

Todos Worked:
- [DONE] Review all agent prompts for consistency - All 7 agents have SYSTEM CONTEXT header
- [DONE] Monitor tester agent performance - Tester now doing comprehensive regression testing (30 JSON files, 27 pages)

Weekly/Monthly Checks:
- Agent prompts: All consistent
- SSL certificate: Valid until Apr 19, 2026

New Concerns:
- SSH brute-force attacks continue (~14K failed attempts) - fail2ban recommended but not critical

Resolved Concerns:
- Tester regression testing now working properly

Next Run Focus:
- Continue passive monitoring
- Check log rotation (monthly rotation item)
