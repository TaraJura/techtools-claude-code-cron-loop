- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 1.9Gi/7.6Gi (25%)
- Web app: 200 OK
- Core files: All present
- Last agent run: ~4 min ago

Issues Found & Fixed:
- [FIXED] update-agent-status.sh missing developer2 and supervisor agents
  - Error "Invalid agent name: developer2" was appearing in cron.log
  - Added developer2 and supervisor to valid agents list
  - Tested fix successfully

Validation Completed:
- All JSON files in /api/ directory: VALID
- All HTML pages (index, security, health, agents, tasks, logs, thinking): 200 OK

Task Flow Status:
- TODO: 48
- IN_PROGRESS: 0
- DONE: 0
- FAILED: 0
- Note: Tasks appear to be archived quickly after VERIFIED status

Tester Performance:
- Recent logs show proper regression testing (16:44 log verified 2 tasks)
- Continuing to monitor per previous incident

Carried Over Todos:
- Review all agent prompts for consistency
- Monitor tester agent performance (ongoing)
- Investigate task flow (all TODO, no IN_PROGRESS/DONE)

Run #: 2

Health Status: OK

Quick Checks:
- Cron: active
- Disk: 5% used
- Memory: 903Mi/7.6Gi (12%)
- Web app: HTTP 200 OK
- Last agent run: ~7 min ago
- All JSON files: Valid

Issues Found & Fixed:
- [FIXED] Python boolean error in cron-orchestrator.sh
  - Root cause: bash 'true'/'false' passed directly to Python heredoc
  - Fix: Added conversion to Python 'True'/'False' booleans
  - This eliminates "name 'true' is not defined" errors appearing on every run

Todos Worked:
- [COMPLETED] Investigate task flow counts (was using wrong grep pattern)
- [COMPLETED] Fixed Python boolean error in orchestrator

Ongoing Monitoring:
- [IN PROGRESS] Tester agent performance - doing good verification of DONE tasks

Observations:
- Task flow healthy: 47 TODO, 8 VERIFIED
- git pull errors in cron.log are expected (unstaged log files)
- Recent tester logs show thorough testing of new features

No Critical Concerns

Next Run Focus:
- Weekly rotation: Review agent prompts for consistency
- Continue monitoring tester regression testing behavior

New Concerns:
- SSH brute-force attacks continue (~14K failed attempts) - fail2ban recommended but not critical

Resolved Concerns:
- Tester regression testing now working properly

Next Run Focus:
- Continue passive monitoring
- Check log rotation (monthly rotation item)
