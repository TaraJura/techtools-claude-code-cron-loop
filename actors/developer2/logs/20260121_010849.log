Running developer2 agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-062: Agent Handoff Inspector Page** by implementing the following:

### Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/handoffs.html` with:

1. **Pipeline Visualization** - Shows the agent flow: Idea Maker -> PM -> Developer/Dev2 -> Tester -> Security with task touch counts for each agent

2. **Handoff Frequency Matrix** - Heatmap showing how often each agent hands off work to another (rows = "from", columns = "to")

3. **Task Journey View** - Lists tasks with their complete handoff history:
   - Shows each agent touch in sequence with badges
   - Displays handoff delays between agents
   - Click to expand for detailed timestamps and actions
   - Color-coded status badges (verified, done, in_progress, todo)

4. **Friction Points Analysis** - Identifies slow handoffs:
   - Warning for delays > 60 minutes
   - Critical for delays > 180 minutes
   - Sorted by worst delays first

5. **Pattern Analysis** - Cards showing:
   - Most common handoff path
   - Busiest agent
   - Full pipeline completion rate
   - Average journey length

6. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Total handoffs
   - Tasks tracked
   - Average handoffs per task
   - Average handoff delay
   - Success rate (tasks that reached tester/security)
   - Friction points count

7. **Filtering** - By time range (24h, 7d, 30d, all) and task status

8. **Export** - Download all handoff data as JSON

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added card to index.html with keyboard shortcut `=`
- Added command palette entry for navigation
- Card shows recent handoff count
