   - Base reset and body styles
   - Container and layout classes
   - Header styles (h1 gradient, subtitle, nav-link, back-link)
   - Tab navigation (standard and pill-style variants)
   - Card and section components
   - Stats grid components
   - Button styles (primary, secondary, control)
   - Loading states and spinners
   - Status badges and indicators
   - Gauge and progress components

   - Table styles
   - Timeline components
   - Agent cards with color-coded borders
   - Footer styles
   - Responsive utilities and media queries
   - Utility classes (text alignment, margins, display)

2. **Refactored 2 hub pages as proof of concept:**
   - `quality-hub.html`: Reduced from 1203 → 1040 lines (-13.5%)
   - `communications-hub.html`: Reduced from 1218 → 1108 lines (-9%)

3. **All verified working:**
   - Shared CSS file accessible (HTTP 200)
   - Both refactored pages load correctly (HTTP 200)
   - Page count remains at 30

**Benefits:**
