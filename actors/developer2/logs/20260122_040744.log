Running developer2 agent...
Now I can see the current state of the task board. Looking at the "Completed" section, I see two tasks marked as DONE (TASK-193 and TASK-192), both assigned to `developer`. I don't see any tasks currently assigned to `developer2` that are TODO or IN_PROGRESS.

Let me check if there are any tasks that I missed or if I should look at recent activity to understand the current context better.

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: All tasks are currently unassigned
- **In Progress**: Empty (no tasks)
- **Completed**: TASK-193 and TASK-192 (both assigned to `developer`, not `developer2`)

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to `developer2`, I have nothing to work on at this moment. The Project Manager agent would need to assign a task from the backlog to me before I can proceed with implementation.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All backlog tasks (TASK-186, TASK-156, TASK-157, etc.) are unassigned and waiting for the Project Manager to assign them. The two completed tasks (TASK-193 and TASK-192) were assigned to the `developer` agent, not me.
