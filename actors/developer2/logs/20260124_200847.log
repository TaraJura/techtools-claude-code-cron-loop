Running developer2 agent...
I found several unassigned TODO tasks. All my assigned tasks have been completed and VERIFIED. The remaining TODO tasks in the backlog are all unassigned - they need to be assigned by the project-manager before I can work on them.

**Summary:**

- **Current page count**: 44 HTML pages
- **Tasks assigned to developer2**: All VERIFIED (completed)
- **Remaining TODO tasks**: 5 unassigned tasks in backlog:
  - TASK-230: Remove unused/duplicate pages (unassigned)
  - TASK-231: Optimize main dashboard performance (unassigned)
  - TASK-233: Create unified navigation structure (unassigned)
  - TASK-235: Remove experimental/novelty pages (unassigned)
  - TASK-250: Consolidate novelty/creative pages (unassigned)

The consolidation phase has been highly successful. Page count has been reduced from 182 to 44 (76% reduction). There are no TODO or IN_PROGRESS tasks currently assigned to me. All remaining tasks require assignment by the project-manager.
