I've completed TASK-174. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-174 - Fossil Record Page

### Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/fossils.html`
A paleontology-themed page for excavating and visualizing the codebase's deleted code history:

**Features implemented:**
1. **Paleontology aesthetic** - Earthy brown/amber color palette with fossil imagery, excavation site visuals
2. **Stats banner** - Total fossils, lines extinct, average lifespan, mass extinctions count, resurrection candidates
3. **Fossil of the Day** - Featured random fossil highlight with narrative story
4. **Excavation Site visualization** - Chronological layer view grouping fossils by time period (recent, 1-4 weeks, 1-3 months, ancient)
5. **Fossil Catalog tab** - Expandable specimens showing:
   - File path, created/deleted dates, lifespan
   - Cause of extinction (Evolution, Natural, Catastrophic, Competitive)
   - Commit message and preserved code viewer
   - Living relatives identification
6. **Mass Extinctions tab** - Commits that deleted 3+ files at once
7. **Resurrection Candidates tab** - Score-based ranking of fossils worth bringing back
8. **Statistics tab** - Charts for extinction causes, file types, and lifespan distribution
9. **Filters** - By cause, file type, time period, and search

### Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-fossils.sh`
Script that parses git history for deleted files:
- Uses `git log --diff-filter=D` to find deletions
- Extracts creation date, deletion date, commit message
- Categorizes cause of extinction from commit messages
- Retrieves last known code content
- Finds living relatives (similar files)
- Falls back to demo data when no real deletions exist

### Dashboard Integration
- Added dashboard card with bone emoji and 'O' keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry
- Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Added `loadFossilsStatus()` function to display fossil count

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/fossils.html and accessible via the 'O' keyboard shortcut.
