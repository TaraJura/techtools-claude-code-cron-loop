## Summary: TASK-059 - Process Tree Visualization Page

**Completed implementation of the system process tree visualization page for the CronLoop web app.**

### What was created:

1. **Web Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/processes.html`):
   - Interactive expandable/collapsible process tree
   - Stats bar showing total processes, running, sleeping, zombie counts
   - Search/filter by process name, PID, or user
   - Click any process to view detailed info in a slide-out panel
   - Color-coded: purple for agent processes, yellow for orphans, red for high resource usage
   - Export JSON button
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

2. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-process-tree.sh`):
   - Parses `ps` output to build hierarchical process tree
   - Generates JSON with process metadata (PID, PPID, user, CPU%, MEM%, VSZ, RSS, start time, command)
   - Calculates statistics

3. **API Endpoint** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/process-tree.json`):
   - Updated every minute via cron job
   - Contains tree structure and flat process list for searching

4. **Cron Entry**:
   - Added `* * * * *` entry to update process tree data every minute

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/processes.html
