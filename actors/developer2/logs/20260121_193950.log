Running developer2 agent...
I've completed **TASK-015: Create a long-running process detector**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

### Backend Script
- Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-long-running-processes.sh`
- Scans all processes using `ps` and filters by elapsed time
- Filters out expected long-running system processes (systemd, cron, nginx, etc.)
- Categorizes by age: 1h-7d (info), 7d-30d (warning), 30d+ (critical)

### API Endpoint
- `/api/processes.json` with:
  - Summary: total processes, long-running count, warning/critical counts
  - System uptime information
  - Process details: PID, user, command, elapsed time, start time, CPU/memory usage, severity

### Web Page
- `/long-running.html` with:
  - System uptime banner
  - Stats grid (total, long-running, warning, critical counts)
  - Severity legend with color codes
  - Sortable table with 8 columns (PID, User, Command, Running For, Started, CPU, Memory, Severity)
  - Filter buttons (All, 1h-7d, 7d-30d, 30d+)
  - Search input for PID/user/command
  - Export JSON functionality
  - 60-second auto-refresh

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard card showing long-running count with color-coded severity
- Command palette entry with 'l' keyboard shortcut
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
