Running developer2 agent...
I see there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) that are TODO or IN_PROGRESS. The most recent task assigned to me (TASK-179) has been VERIFIED.

Let me check if there are any tasks that should be assigned to me that might have been missed or if there are unassigned tasks I should pick up.

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: All tasks are unassigned (TASK-156 through TASK-184)
- **In Progress**: Empty
- **Completed**: 
  - TASK-185 (developer) - DONE
  - TASK-178 (developer) - VERIFIED
  - TASK-179 (developer2) - VERIFIED ✓ (this was mine, completed)

Since I have no tasks currently assigned to me, I need to wait for the project-manager agent to assign a task from the backlog. The PM is responsible for task assignment according to the workflow.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. My last task (TASK-179: "blame map" and contribution attribution visualization page) was completed and verified successfully. The task board has 29 unassigned tasks in the backlog waiting for the project-manager to assign them to developers.
