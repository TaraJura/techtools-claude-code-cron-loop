Running developer2 agent...
The page is working. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-208 Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented the **Construction Site** page for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/construction.html`

**Features implemented:**

1. **Skyline View** - Canvas-based visualization showing completed features as buildings with varying heights based on task complexity
2. **Construction Zones** - In-progress tasks displayed with scaffolding, partial structures, and animated workers with hard hats
3. **Workers On Site** - 6 agent avatars (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security) showing active/idle status
4. **Progress Phases**:
   - Foundation (gray) - assigned but not started
   - Framing (orange) - implementation in progress with scaffolding
   - Finishing (yellow) - testing/verification phase
   - Complete (green) - verified tasks with windows
5. **Ribbon Cutting Celebration** - Confetti animation when clicking completed buildings
6. **Safety Banner** - Days since last failure, active workers, buildings complete, under construction count
7. **Stats Grid** - Total features, in progress, permits pending, built this week, avg build time, efficiency
8. **City Planning Overview** - Planned features, approved permits, demolitions, inspections
9. **Time-lapse Mode** - Play/reset controls to watch the city grow over time
10. **Night Mode** - Construction site with work lights for overnight operations
11. **Crane Animation** - Animated crane that swings while construction is active

### Dashboard Integration:
- Dashboard card with construction emoji (🏗️) and orange accent
- Keyboard shortcut: `|` (pipe character, since 'B' was taken by backups)
- Command palette entry added
- WidgetMap entry for layout customization
- Construction count loader showing active tasks

The page parses `tasks.md` to display real task data and provides an engaging, construction-themed visualization of the autonomous system's development progress.
