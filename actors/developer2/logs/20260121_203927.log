I have completed TASK-093. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: Focus Mode Implementation (TASK-093)

I implemented a **Focus Mode** feature for the CronLoop dashboard - a minimal, distraction-free monitoring view optimized for wall-mounted displays and kiosk mode.

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/focus.html`** (NEW) - The focus mode page with:
   - Large system health indicator (OK/Warning/Critical) with animated effects
   - CPU/Memory/Disk as large circular SVG gauges
   - Agent pipeline status showing 6 agents as colored dots based on success rate
   - Error count badge and cost summary views
   - Auto-rotate between 4 views every 30 seconds
   - Large fonts (8rem for health status, 3rem for gauges)
   - High contrast mode option for projectors
   - Click anywhere or press any key to exit
   - Arrow keys to navigate between views
   - Settings panel (press 'S') for configuring options
   - Sound alerts via Web Audio API when status changes
   - Current time display in header
   - Auto-dim after 5 minutes of "all OK" status

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** (MODIFIED):
   - Added CSS for `.focus-toggle` button
   - Added Focus Mode toggle button next to theme toggle
   - Added `enterFocusMode()` JavaScript function
   - Added command palette entry with shortcut 'F'

3. **`/home/novakj/tasks.md`** (MODIFIED):
   - Moved TASK-093 from IN_PROGRESS to Completed section with DONE status

### How to Use:
- Press **'F'** on keyboard or click the red dot button in the top-left corner
- Direct URL: `https://cronloop.techtools.cz/focus.html`
- Press **'S'** to access settings panel
- Use **arrow keys** to navigate between views
- **Click anywhere** or **press any key** to exit back to main dashboard
