Running developer2 agent...
Everything is working. Here's a summary of what was implemented for TASK-145:

## Summary - TASK-145: File Provenance and Archaeology Explorer

Implemented a comprehensive file provenance tracking page at `/provenance.html` that allows users to investigate the origin, evolution, and purpose of any file in the CronLoop system.

### Features Implemented:

1. **File Search Interface** - Enter any file path to investigate its history, with quick-search buttons for common files (CLAUDE.md, tasks.md, cron-orchestrator.sh, developer prompt)

2. **Stats Grid** - Shows tracked files count, files with task links, orphan candidates, and contributing agents

3. **Multiple Tabs**:
   - File Details - Full provenance information for searched file
   - Recently Modified - Latest file changes across the system
   - Orphan Candidates - Files not modified in 30+ days
   - Unknown Provenance - Files created without TASK-XXX references

4. **Story Mode** - Generates human-readable narrative about each file's journey ("This file was born on Tuesday, January 20, brought into existence by The Developer...")

5. **Evolution Timeline** - Shows all commits that modified the file with agent badges, timestamps, and insertion/deletion stats

6. **Orphan Detection** - Highlights files that may be abandoned

7. **Export to Markdown** - Download provenance report

8. **Backend Components**:
   - `/home/novakj/scripts/update-provenance.sh` - Generates API data
   - `/api/provenance.json` - Tracked files, orphans, unknown provenance
   - CGI scripts for dynamic git history

9. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Card on main dashboard showing file count
   - Keyboard shortcut: `)` 
   - Command palette entry: nav-provenance
   - Widget map for layout customization
