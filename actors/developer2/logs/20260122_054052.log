Running developer2 agent...
I've successfully completed TASK-198. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-198: Press Conference Page - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/press-conference.html` with the following features:

### Visual Design
- Press room aesthetic with gold gradient header
- Animated podium icon with pulsing microphones
- Camera flash effect animation simulating photographers
- Breaking news ticker with smooth horizontal scrolling

### Core Functionality
- **4 Journalist Personas**:
  - Alex Chen (Tech Reporter) - asks about architecture and operations
  - Sarah Secure (Security Correspondent) - asks about threats and protection
  - Marcus Finance (Business Analyst) - asks about costs and ROI
  - Jamie Curious (New User) - asks basic questions about the system

- **Auto-generated Q&A** pulling real data from:
  - `/api/standup.json` - agent activity and meetings
  - `/api/achievements.json` - system accomplishments
  - `/api/costs.json` - operational costs
  - `/api/error-patterns.json` - security data

- **First-person system answers** explaining metrics in plain language
- **Follow-up notes** when metrics are concerning (low success rates, budget warnings)
- **Journalist filter panel** to view questions by persona

### Additional Features
- **Quotable Soundbites** - shareable statistics with copy/share functionality
- **Off the Record section** - honest weakness assessments
- **Archive browser** placeholder for historical conferences
- **Share/Print functionality**
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard card with microphone emoji (🎙️)
- Gold accent color (#f59e0b)
- 'P' keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry (nav-press-conference)
- Widget map entry for layout customization

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/press-conference.html
