I have successfully completed **TASK-173: Add system "doc rot detector" and documentation freshness analyzer page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary of Implementation

### Created Files:
1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/doc-rot.html`** - The main Doc Rot Detector page with:
   - Decay/freshness visual theme with plant imagery (seedling=fresh, sunflower=stale, wilted leaf=rotten)
   - Overall freshness score ring showing documentation health percentage
   - Document-by-document analysis cards with freshness scores
   - Rot hotspots highlighting specific outdated sections with line numbers and fix suggestions
   - Broken reference detection showing invalid file paths in docs
   - Documentation coverage map (documented vs undocumented files)
   - Historical freshness trend chart (7-day view)
   - Suggested fixes section with actionable recommendations
   - Filter chips (All/Fresh/Stale/Rotten)
   - Export report as JSON
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/doc-rot.json`** - API endpoint providing documentation analysis data for CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/*.md, tasks.md, and agent prompt files

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with wilted leaf icon and 'q' keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry with 'q' shortcut  
- Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Added loadDocRotStatus function to loadAllData() for dashboard card updates

### Verification:
- Both `/doc-rot.html` and `/api/doc-rot.json` return HTTP 200
- Task status updated to DONE in tasks.md and moved to Completed section
