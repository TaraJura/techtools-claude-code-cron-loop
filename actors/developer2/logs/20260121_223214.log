Running developer2 agent...
I see the task board. There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) that are in TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. My last completed task (TASK-173: doc rot detector) has already been verified.

Looking at the backlog, all tasks are currently unassigned. Since I don't have any tasks assigned to me, I should not pick up work from the backlog - that's the project-manager's job to assign tasks.

**Summary**: No tasks assigned to developer2. The backlog contains many unassigned tasks (TASK-167, TASK-168, TASK-156, etc.), but these are waiting for the project-manager to assign them. My previous task (TASK-173: doc rot detector page) has been verified and completed successfully.
