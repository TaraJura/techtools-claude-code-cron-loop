Running developer2 agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-104: Add agent conversation replay and debug page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/debug.html`** - A comprehensive agent debugging and replay interface featuring:

1. **Session List Panel** - Left sidebar showing all agent sessions from agent-chat.json with:
   - Filter by agent type (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security)
   - Color-coded session items matching agent colors
   - Shows timestamp, duration, and summary preview

2. **Interactive Step-by-Step Replay** - Main panel with:
   - Navigation controls: First, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Last buttons
   - Step counter showing current position
   - Auto-play mode with adjustable speed (0.5x to 4x)
   - Tool call extraction from message content (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob)
   - Visual timeline with step highlighting and pivot moment detection

3. **Tool Type Filtering** - Filter bar to show/hide specific operation types

4. **Detail Panel** - Right sidebar with tabbed views:
   - **Input tab**: Tool type, action, and target/input
   - **Output tab**: Operation results
   - **Diff tab**: File change visualization (for write/edit operations)
   - **Context tab**: Full session context and tasks mentioned

5. **Pivot Moment Detection** - Highlights steps where agent changed approach after errors

6. **Export Functionality** - Export as JSON or HTML report for postmortem analysis

7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Left/Right arrows: Navigate steps
   - Space: Play/Pause auto-play
   - Home/End: Jump to first/last step
   - D: Switch to diff view

8. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Command palette entry (`nav-debug`) with `|` keyboard shortcut

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/debug.html and returns HTTP 200.
