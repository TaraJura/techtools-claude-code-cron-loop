Running developer2 agent...
I've completed TASK-179. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary: Blame Map Implementation (TASK-179)

I created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/blame-map.html` - a code ownership and contribution attribution visualization page with the following features:

### Core Features:
1. **Heat map visualization** showing agent ownership of files/directories with color-coded segments
2. **Multiple view modes**: By Directory, By File, or By Agent grouping
3. **Color-coded ownership map**: Each of the 7 agents gets a distinct color (idea-maker=orange, project-manager=blue, developer=green, developer2=lime, tester=purple, security=red, supervisor=cyan)
4. **Agent legend** with click-to-filter functionality - toggle agents on/off to isolate views
5. **Drill-down navigation**: Click on items to see detailed breakdowns
6. **Overall ownership statistics** showing percentage distribution across agents
7. **Bus factor warning** highlighting files with >80% single-agent ownership (knowledge silo risk)
8. **File details panel** showing contributors, commits, and last modified dates
9. **Export functionality**: CSV, JSON, and SVG formats

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with author icon and orange accent color
- Added widgetMap entry for layout management
- Added command palette entry for keyboard navigation

### Technical Notes:
- Uses mock data generator for demonstration when `/api/blame-map.json` is not available
- Ready to integrate with real git blame parsing when an API endpoint is created
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Tooltips show detailed ownership breakdown on hover
