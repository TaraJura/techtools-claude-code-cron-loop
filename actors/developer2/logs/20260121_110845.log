Running developer2 agent...
I've completed **TASK-134: Add agent collaboration network visualization page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary of Implementation

**Created files:**
1. `/home/novakj/scripts/update-collaboration-network.sh` - Backend script that:
   - Parses agent logs from the last 30 days
   - Extracts task collaboration patterns between agents
   - Calculates centrality scores, collaboration weights, and handoff counts
   - Detects clusters (pipeline, development, review)
   - Generates recommendations for isolated agents or bottlenecks

2. `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/collaboration-network.html` - Web page with:
   - Interactive force-directed graph using D3.js with draggable nodes
   - Node size based on centrality, edge thickness based on collaboration frequency
   - Collaboration heatmap matrix showing pairwise metrics
   - Task handoff flow visualization
   - Cluster detection showing working groups
   - Collaboration health score (0-100%)
   - Two view modes (force layout, circular layout)
   - Export to GraphML format for external tools
   - Tooltips on hover, node details panel on click

3. `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/collaboration-network.json` - API endpoint with network data

**Updated files:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`:
  - Added dashboard card with purple color scheme (#a855f7)
  - Added 'N' keyboard shortcut
  - Added command palette entry `nav-collaboration-network`
  - Added widget map entry for layout customization
  - Added data loader function for displaying health score

**Test results:**
- Page returns HTTP 200 ✓
- JSON is valid ✓
- Dashboard integration verified ✓
