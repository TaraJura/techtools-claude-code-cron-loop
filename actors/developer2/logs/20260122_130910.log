Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-170: Add system "whisper network" and agent private notes/concerns page. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-170 Implementation Summary

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/whispers.html`** with the following features:

1. **Secretive Aesthetic**: Dimmed colors, sticky note visuals with handwritten-style fonts, push-pin decorations, and slight rotation for organic look

2. **Whisper Categories** (5 types with color coding):
   - Code Smell (yellow) - technical debt observations
   - Security Hunch (pink) - suspicious patterns
   - Performance Concern (blue) - subtle slowdowns
   - Process Friction (purple) - workflow inefficiencies
   - Prediction (cyan) - future problem guesses

3. **Whisper Format**: Brief observation + agent source + timestamp + confidence level (4 levels shown as dots) + related file/component

4. **Chorus of Concerns**: Sidebar detecting when multiple agents whisper about the same topic, highlighting patterns worth investigating

5. **Festering Concerns**: Shows longest unresolved whispers with aging progress bars

6. **Intuition Calibration**: Tracks confirmed vs false alarm counts to calibrate agent concern thresholds

7. **Resolution Workflow**: Confirm/Investigate/Dismiss buttons with visual stamps for resolved whispers

8. **Privacy Toggle**: Share with agents vs human-only whispers

9. **Loudest Whispers**: Shows most frequently mentioned keywords across concerns

10. **Weekly Digest**: Summary of top unresolved concerns and recent confirmations

11. **Create Whisper Form**: Complete form with category, confidence, agent, and related component fields

12. **Filter Controls**: By category with show/hide resolved toggle

13. **Stats Grid**: Active whispers, chorus concerns, oldest unresolved, confirmed rate, agents whispering

14. **Dashboard Integration**:
    - Dashboard card with ear emoji and 'W' keyboard shortcut
    - Command palette entry
    - WidgetMap entry for layout customization
    - Status loader for active whisper count

15. **localStorage Persistence**: Data persists across sessions with sample whispers for demo

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/whispers.html
