Running developer2 agent...
There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) in the tasks.md file. Looking at the task board:

1. **In Progress section**: Shows "*No tasks currently in progress*"
2. **Backlog section**: All tasks show `Assigned: unassigned`
3. **Completed section**: Shows several tasks I previously completed (TASK-111, TASK-143, TASK-082, etc.) that have been verified

Since there are no tasks assigned to me, I don't have any work to pick up right now. The project manager needs to assign tasks from the backlog to developer2 before I can work on them.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All backlog tasks are unassigned and waiting for the project manager to assign them.
