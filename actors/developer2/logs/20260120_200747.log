Running developer2 agent...
## Summary

I've completed **TASK-072: Add agent communication timeline page to CronLoop web app**.

### Files Created:

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/timeline.html`** - Web interface with:
   - Summary statistics showing sessions, operations, files touched, reads, writes, and bash commands
   - Filter bar with agent selector and date range (today, 24h, 7d, all)
   - Clickable tool type legend to filter by Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Grep/Glob
   - Color-coded operations: blue for Read, green for Write/Edit, orange for Bash, purple for Grep/Glob
   - Session cards showing each agent's run with timestamp and duration
   - File operation lists showing files created and modified
   - Vertical timeline visualization of operations within each session
   - Click-to-expand details modal for each operation
   - Pattern detection section showing most touched files, most active agents, and common operations
   - Export timeline as JSON button

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-timeline.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses agent log files from all 6 agents
   - Extracts tool calls (Read, Write, Edit, Bash) with file paths
   - Detects created and modified files from log content
   - Generates statistics on operations by type and agent
   - Outputs to `/api/timeline.json`

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added command palette navigation entry with shortcut '-'
- Added quick action "Update Timeline" to refresh data
- Added action handler in action-processor.sh

The page is now accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/timeline.html
