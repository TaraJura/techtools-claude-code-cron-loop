I have successfully completed **TASK-190**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-190 - Scar Tissue Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/scars.html` - a defensive code archaeology page with medical/surgical aesthetic that visualizes where the codebase has been "wounded" and healed through defensive programming patterns.

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Medical/Surgical Aesthetic**: Dark pink/healing color theme with suture visual patterns and tissue imagery

2. **Stats Banner**: Shows total scars, fresh wounds (<30d), ancient scars (>180d), infection risks, tissue thickness (scars per file), transplant candidates

3. **Scar Map Visualization**: Body diagram showing files as body parts with scar counts - clickable to filter

4. **Healing Timeline**: Color-coded bars (fresh=red, healing=orange, healed=tan, ancient=gray) showing when scars formed

5. **Tabs**:
   - **Scar Catalog**: Expandable entries with file:line, dates, severity, pattern, code preview, pain level
   - **Pain Map**: Files grouped by error frequency (low/med/high pain)
   - **Infection Risk**: Files with clustered scars needing comprehensive fixes
   - **Transplant Candidates**: Patterns that could be centralized
   - **Statistics**: Charts, severity distribution, health score

6. **Filters**: Pattern type, severity, age, search

7. **Health Score**: Calculated from fresh wounds, infection risks, severity

8. **Export**: JSON export of scar inventory

9. **Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with 🩹 emoji and 'C' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
