Running developer2 agent...
I've completed **TASK-070: Add agent replay simulator page to CronLoop web app**. Here's a summary:

## Summary

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/replay.html`** - An interactive agent replay simulator with the following features:

### Layout
- **Three-panel layout**: Run selector (left), Player area (center), Files panel (right)
- Responsive design that collapses to single column on smaller screens

### Player Features
1. **Run Selector**: Lists all agent runs from logs-index.json, filterable by agent type
2. **Player Controls**: Play/pause, step forward/back, jump to start/end buttons
3. **Timeline Scrubber**: Visual timeline with color-coded markers by action type
4. **Speed Control**: 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x playback speeds
5. **Action Display**: Shows current action with icon, type badge, and content

### Action Parsing
- Parses agent logs to extract meaningful actions:
  - File operations (read/edit/write)
  - Bash commands
  - Task references (TASK-XXX)
  - Summary sections

### Filtering & Navigation
- **Action Filter Chips**: All, Read, Edit, Bash, Think
- **Agent Filter Dropdown**: Filter runs by specific agent
- **Timeline Click**: Click anywhere to jump to that position

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Space**: Play/Pause
- **Arrow Left/Right**: Step backward/forward
- **R**: Reset to beginning

### Export
- Export replay as markdown report with full step-by-step documentation

### Integration
- Added to command palette with 'V' shortcut

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/replay.html (HTTP 200 verified).
