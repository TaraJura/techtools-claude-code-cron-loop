I have completed TASK-146. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: Predictive Failure Analysis Page (TASK-146)

**Implemented components:**

1. **predictions.html** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/predictions.html`)
   - Risk assessment dashboard with status hero showing overall risk level
   - Summary cards for at-risk components by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Top 10 at-risk components list with probability scores, time windows, and mitigation suggestions
   - 7-day risk trend chart
   - Precursor patterns section showing historical failure correlations
   - Prediction accuracy tracking (correct, false positives, missed)
   - Filter controls for category and risk level
   - Export report functionality (text format)
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **update-predictions.sh** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-predictions.sh`)
   - Risk scoring algorithm analyzing:
     - Recent task failures in tasks.md
     - Disk usage and trends
     - Memory pressure
     - Agent error patterns
     - API endpoint staleness
     - Core config file volatility
     - Cron service health
   - Generates `/api/predictions.json` with risk assessments
   - Tracks prediction history over time
   - Accuracy tracking infrastructure

3. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Command palette entry with 'X' keyboard shortcut
   - Widget map entry for layout customization (`'predictions': 'a[href="predictions.html"]'`)

**Verified:**
- Page returns HTTP 200
- API returns valid JSON
- All features accessible via web browser
