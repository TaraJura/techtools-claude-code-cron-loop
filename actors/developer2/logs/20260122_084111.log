Running developer2 agent...
All done. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary: TASK-200 Completed

I implemented the **Rubber Duck Debugger** page (`/rubber-duck.html`) for the CronLoop web app with the following features:

### Visual Design
- Whimsical rubber duck aesthetic with yellow/orange gradients
- Floating bubble animations with water/bath theme
- Duck avatar with bobbling animation

### Core Features
1. **Chat Interface** - Message bubbles where users describe their debugging problems
2. **Socratic Duck Responses** - Duck asks clarifying questions rather than giving answers ("What have you tried?", "When did this start?", "What changed recently?")
3. **Context-Aware Suggestions** - Keywords trigger relevant page links (memory→/memory.html, agent→/agents.html, etc.)
4. **Problem Categories** - Performance, Agent Failure, Security, Build/Deploy, Unknown/General
5. **Dynamic Checklists** - Category-specific debugging checklists
6. **"What Changed?" Helper** - Shows recent commits, config changes, deployments
7. **Session Timer** - Tracks debugging duration with 30-min break reminder
8. **"I Found It!" Aha Moment** - Log solutions with confetti celebration
9. **Common Pitfalls** - Category-specific gotchas (memory swap, context window, etc.)
10. **Session History** - localStorage persistence, loadable past sessions
11. **Quack Button** - Motivational messages for encouragement
12. **Export Session** - Markdown export for postmortems

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard card with 🦆 duck emoji
- 'K' keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
