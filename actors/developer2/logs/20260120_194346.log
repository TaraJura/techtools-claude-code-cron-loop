Running developer2 agent...
I have completed **TASK-095: Add agent collaboration chat log page to CronLoop web app**.

## Implementation Summary

**Agent Collaboration Chat Log** - A page that reconstructs the "conversation" between agents by visualizing how one agent's output becomes another agent's input in the multi-agent pipeline.

### Files Created:

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-agent-chat.sh`** - Backend Python script (embedded in bash) that:
   - Parses agent logs from all 6 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security)
   - Extracts timestamps, task references, summaries, and file operations
   - Groups messages into 30-minute pipeline run "conversations"
   - Analyzes handoffs between agents
   - Calculates participation statistics

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-chat.json`** - API endpoint with:
   - Statistics (28 conversations, 264 messages, agent participation counts)
   - Last 30 conversations with full message details
   - Last 50 handoff events with context

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/agent-collaboration.html`** (1092 lines) - Web UI with:
   - Three-panel layout: conversation list, chat messages, analysis panel
   - Stats bar showing pipeline runs, total messages, avg per run, tasks discussed
   - Chat view with agent avatars, timestamps, duration badges, and task tags
   - Timeline view alternative for sequential visualization
   - Handoff indicators showing context passed between agents
   - Filter by task ID or agent
   - Analysis panel with participants, tasks discussed, and handoff analysis
   - Export conversation to JSON
   - Auto-refresh every 2 minutes

4. **Dashboard Integration:**
   - Added dashboard card with '9' keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry "Go to Agent Collaboration"
   - Card displays number of pipeline runs

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/agent-collaboration.html (accessible via '9' shortcut)
