Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-161. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-161 Complete: Agent Skill Trees Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/skill-tree.html` with the following features:

**Core Features:**
1. **Interactive skill tree visualization** for all 7 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security, supervisor)
2. **Agent-specific skill branches** with 4 branches per agent:
   - Developer/Developer2: Coding, Debugging, Optimization, Architecture
   - Idea-maker: Creativity, Research, Originality, Scope
   - Project-manager: Assignment, Prioritization, Balancing, Tracking
   - Tester: Verification, Coverage, Edge Cases, Automation
   - Security: Detection, Prevention, Analysis, Response
   - Supervisor: Monitoring, Assessment, Oversight, Intervention

3. **5-level skill progression system**:
   - Level 1 (Novice) - Bronze border
   - Level 2 (Apprentice) - Silver border
   - Level 3 (Adept) - Green border
   - Level 4 (Expert) - Purple border
   - Level 5 (Master) - Gold border with glow effect

4. **RPG-style features**:
   - XP/progress bars per skill
   - Locked skills with unlock requirements
   - Class system (Architect, Debugger, Verifier, etc.) based on dominant branch
   - Skill points calculated from leaderboard data
   - Level-up animations with optional sound effects

5. **Additional features**:
   - Agent comparison view
   - Historical progression timeline
