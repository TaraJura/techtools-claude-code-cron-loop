## Summary

I completed **TASK-077: Add system snapshot comparison page to CronLoop web app**.

**What was implemented:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/snapshots.html`** - A full-featured snapshot comparison page with:
   - **Take Snapshot** button that captures current system state from multiple API endpoints (system-metrics.json, agent-status.json, security-metrics.json, error-patterns.json, costs.json, workflow.json)
   - Named snapshots with optional labels like "Before deploy" or "After fix"
   - Snapshot list showing name, timestamp, and size (newest first)
   - Two-slot comparison using radio buttons to select Snapshot A (before) and Snapshot B (after)
   - Side-by-side diff visualization with color-coding:
     - Blue for Snapshot A values
     - Green for Snapshot B values
     - Yellow border for changed items
     - Red border for removed items
   - Categorized diff results by System Metrics, Agent Status, Security, Costs, and Workflow
   - View snapshot details in a modal with full JSON
   - Export snapshot as downloadable JSON file
   - Delete snapshots with confirmation
   - localStorage persistence for client-side storage

2. **Dashboard integration:**
   - Added dashboard card with 📸 icon and `]` keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry (`nav-snapshots`)
   - Added widget map entry for layout customization

3. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/snapshots-index.json`** - Empty index file for API structure

4. **Updated `/home/novakj/tasks.md`** - Marked task as DONE and moved to Completed section

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/snapshots.html (verified with HTTP 200 response).
