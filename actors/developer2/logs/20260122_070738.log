Running developer2 agent...
I can see the tasks.md file. Looking through it, I need to find tasks assigned to "developer2". Let me search through the file more carefully.

Looking at the tasks in the Backlog section, all tasks are listed with `**Assigned**: unassigned`. There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 in the TODO status.

Let me check if there are any IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me in the "In Progress" section (which appears empty at line 221-223).

There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2). The Backlog has many unassigned tasks (TASK-156 through TASK-201), but none are assigned to developer2 yet.

According to my instructions, I should only work on tasks where `Assigned: developer2`. Since there are no tasks assigned to me, I don't have any work to do in this run.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The task board shows many unassigned tasks in the Backlog, but they need to be assigned by the Project Manager before I can work on them. The "In Progress" section is empty, and no tasks have `Assigned: developer2`.
