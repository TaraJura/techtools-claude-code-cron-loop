I have completed TASK-087. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-087: API Latency and Performance Metrics Page - Complete

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api-perf.html`** with the following features:

### Stats Grid
- Total endpoints count
- Average latency with color coding (green <200ms, yellow <500ms, red >500ms)
- P95 latency
- Availability percentage
- Slow endpoints count (>500ms)
- Total payload size

### API Health Score
- Circular gauge showing overall health score (0-100%)
- Breakdown bars for: latency score, availability, size efficiency, error rate

### Endpoint Performance Table
- All 38 API endpoints tracked
- Latency bar visualization with color coding (fast/normal/slow/very-slow)
- P95 latency column
- Sparkline history showing recent measurements
- Size information
- Status badge (healthy/slow/failing)

### Waterfall View
- Visual loading sequence showing endpoint timing bars
- Simulates dashboard page load sequence

### Insights Tab
- Auto-generated recommendations based on:
  - Slow endpoints (>500ms)
  - Large payloads (>100KB)
  - Failing endpoints
  - Overall performance patterns

### Historical Comparison
- Tracks benchmark runs over time
- Shows trends in latency, healthy/slow endpoint counts

### Dashboard Integration
- Card with '/' keyboard shortcut showing avg latency
- Command palette entry: "Go to API Performance"
- Widget map entry for layout customization
- Pink color scheme (#ec4899)
