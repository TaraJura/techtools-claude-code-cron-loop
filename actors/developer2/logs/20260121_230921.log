I have completed **TASK-168: Add system "deja vu" and pattern recognition memory page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary of Implementation

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/dejavu.html`** (1837 lines) with:

1. **Glitchy, memory-flashback aesthetic** - CSS animations with glitch effects, floating brain icon, and pulsing elements suggesting pattern recognition

2. **Pattern Database** - Displays 12 recurring situation types (SSH attacks, disk warnings, syntax errors, etc.) with occurrence counts, first/last seen dates, and average resolution times

3. **Deja Vu Moments Timeline** - Shows when the system encountered familiar situations with side-by-side comparison of past vs present handling and improvement percentages

4. **Evolution View** - Shows how responses evolved through 4 stages: Panic -> Recovery -> Prevention -> Anticipation

5. **Learning Curve Chart** - SVG chart showing decreasing time-to-resolution over 6 weeks

6. **False Memories Section** - Displays misclassification cases where the system incorrectly identified patterns

7. **Recurring Nightmares** - Problems that keep returning despite fixes, with root cause analysis prompts

8. **Prediction Engine** - Shows predicted future issues based on historical patterns with confidence levels

9. **Memory Score** - Overall pattern recognition accuracy displayed as percentage (78% example)

10. **Forgotten Lessons** - Patterns where the system regressed to earlier behavior

11. **Audio/Visual Notifications** - Toggle-able sound alerts when new deja vu moments detected

12. **Category Filtering** - Filter by Security, Performance, Errors, or Tasks

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/dejavu.json`** - API endpoint providing all pattern data

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Added dashboard card with brain emoji (🧠) and 'D' keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry with 'D' shortcut
- Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Added JavaScript loader to display memory score on dashboard
