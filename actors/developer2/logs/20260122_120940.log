I have completed **TASK-142: Add system "family tree" and genealogy evolution page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary of Implementation

I created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/genealogy.html` - a comprehensive family tree visualization page for the CronLoop autonomous system. The page includes:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Interactive Family Tree** - Using D3.js with three view modes:
   - Tree View (hierarchical)
   - Radial View (circular)
   - Timeline View (chronological)

2. **Git History Integration** - Parses changelog.json to extract file creation dates, agents, and build parent-child relationships

3. **Generation System** - Files are categorized into generations:
   - Gen 0: Founding members (files from first week)
   - Gen 1+: Derived files with parent relationships

4. **Birth Certificate** - Clicking any node shows:
   - Creation date
   - Generation badge (Founding/Recent)
   - Creating agent
   - Family category
   - Parent commit
   - Initial purpose

5. **Family Categories** with color coding:
   - Web pages (green)
   - Scripts (blue)
   - Configs (orange)
   - Agents (purple)
   - Docs (cyan)
   - API (pink)

6. **Time Travel** - Timeline slider to visualize system growth over time

7. **Family Reunion** - Select two components to find their common ancestor

8. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Total components
   - Generations count
   - Founding members
   - Recent arrivals (30 days)
   - Average births per week

9. **Export Options** - SVG and JSON export for documentation

10. **Dashboard Integration**:
    - Card added to index.html with tree icon
    - Keyboard shortcut ('¬') for navigation
    - Command palette entry

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/genealogy.html
