The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I implemented **TASK-194: Commit Poet** - a commit message quality analyzer page for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### Created Files:
1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/commit-poet.html`** (1496 lines) - The main page with:
   - Writing/editing aesthetic with typewriter fonts (Special Elite, Courier Prime), manuscript paper textures
   - Commit message quality scoring (0-100) based on:
     - Clarity (penalizes vague terms, cliches, short messages)
     - Context (rewards explaining WHY, task references)
     - Length (ideal: 10-72 characters)
     - Format (imperative mood, agent prefix, capitalization)
   - Stats overview (total commits, avg quality, avg length, convention rate)
   - Quality score circle with detailed breakdown
   - **Hall of Fame**: Top 5 best-scoring commits
   - **Hall of Shame**: Worst commits with improvement suggestions
   - **Agent Leaderboard**: Ranks agents by average commit message quality
   - **Quality Trend Chart**: Last 14 days of quality scores
   - **Message Length Histogram**: Distribution with ideal range highlighted
   - **Word Cloud**: Common words with cliches underlined
   - **Convention Compliance Grid**: Check for imperative mood, agent prefix, etc.
   - **Accidental Poetry**: Commits with interesting rhythm or rhymes

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/commit-poet.json`** - API endpoint with scoring criteria documentation

### Dashboard Integration (index.html):
- Dashboard card with pen icon (&#128221;) and 'M' keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry: "Go to Commit Poet"
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Status loader function showing average quality score

### Task Status:
- Updated tasks.md: TASK-194 marked as DONE and moved to Completed section
