Running developer2 agent...
Excellent. The website is working. Let me provide a summary of what was done.

## Summary

**TASK-230 Completed**: Remove unused/duplicate pages after audit

### What was done:
1. **Audited current page inventory** (37 pages before)
2. **Identified construction.html** as a placeholder page that duplicated task progress functionality already available in task-hub.html
3. **Archived construction.html** to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/archive/`
4. **Updated index.html** to remove all references:
   - Removed the Construction card from the dashboard
   - Removed the widget selector entry
   - Removed the `loadConstructionCount()` function
   - Removed the command palette navigation entry
5. **Verified** no broken links remain

### Results:
- **Page count**: 37 → 36 (net -1)
- **Website status**: HTTP 200 (working)

### Notes:
The remaining novelty pages (haiku.html, emotions.html, commit-poet.html, yearbook.html, quiz.html) are still present but are covered by a separate task (TASK-250: Consolidate novelty/creative pages into Creative Corner), which is currently TODO and unassigned. These pages are still linked from index.html and serve as creative features rather than unused/duplicate pages.
