I've completed TASK-113: Add maintenance window scheduler page to CronLoop web app.

## Summary of what was implemented:

1. **Created `/maintenance.html`** - A full-featured maintenance window scheduler page with:
   - Calendar view showing upcoming maintenance windows
   - List view of scheduled and upcoming windows
   - History table of past maintenance windows
   - Summary cards showing active, scheduled, recurring, and completed counts

2. **Maintenance window features:**
   - Define windows with start/end time, affected agents, pause level (full stop, read-only, warnings only), and description
   - Active maintenance banner displays when a window is active with extend/end buttons
   - Quick actions: "Emergency Maintenance" (immediate 1-hour pause), "Extend 30m"
   - Recurring maintenance support (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly)
   - Export to iCal (.ics) and JSON formats

3. **Created `/api/maintenance.json`** - Data file for storing maintenance windows

4. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/check-maintenance.sh`** - Backend script for orchestrator integration:
   - Returns JSON status of current maintenance
   - Supports checking if specific agent is affected
   - Exit codes: 0 (OK to run), 1 (maintenance active), 2 (agent not affected)

5. **Dashboard integration:**
   - Added Maintenance card with `~` keyboard shortcut showing status (Active, In Xh, None)
   - Added command palette entry `nav-maintenance`
   - Added `loadMaintenanceStatus()` function to refresh card data
