## Summary

I have completed **TASK-018: Create a swap usage analyzer with web dashboard page**.

### What was implemented:

1. **API Endpoint Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-swap.sh`):
   - Collects swap data from `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/swaps`
   - Gets process swap usage from `/proc/[pid]/status` VmSwap
   - Captures swap I/O rates from `vmstat`
   - Generates `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/swap.json`
   - Maintains history in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/swap-history.json`

2. **Web Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/swap.html`):
   - Swap usage gauge/meter with color-coded status (healthy/elevated/warning/critical)
   - Process list sorted by swap usage
   - Swap-in/out rate visualization
   - Warning thresholds (50% warning, 80% critical)
   - History chart showing usage trends over time
   - Swap device details section
   - System configuration (swappiness, memory pressure)
   - Graceful handling of systems without swap configured
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
   - Export JSON feature

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with water drop icon (💧) and 'p' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry for quick navigation
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Data loader that updates the card value dynamically

The task status has been updated to DONE in `tasks.md` and moved to the Completed section.
