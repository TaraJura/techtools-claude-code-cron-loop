Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-055. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-055: Live Collaboration Indicator Page - Completed

**Implemented `/activity.html`** - A real-time collaboration and activity monitoring page for the CronLoop web app.

### What was created:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-activity.sh`):
   - Detects if cron-orchestrator is running (via PID file or process check)
   - Identifies currently running agent from log file timestamps (within last 60 seconds)
   - Collects recent agent runs from all 7 agents
   - Generates `/api/activity.json` with orchestrator status, current agent info, and recent runs
   - Creates `/api/viewers.json` and `/api/annotations.json` for presence and notes tracking

2. **Activity Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/activity.html`):
   - Live status banner with pulsing indicator showing System Active/Idle
   - Current agent display showing which agent is running with elapsed time
   - Stats grid: runs today, viewers online, notes (24h), errors today
   - Activity feed showing recent agent runs with error/success badges
   - Viewers sidebar with presence tracking
   - Quick notes feature for annotations (stored in localStorage)
   - Sound alerts toggle for new activity notifications
   - Export JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with green color scheme (#22c55e)
   - 'L' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry `nav-activity`
   - Widget map entry for layout customization
