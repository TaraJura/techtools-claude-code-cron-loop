I have completed TASK-020. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-020 - Git Repository Health Checker

**Implemented at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/git-health.html

### Features:
1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-git-health.sh`):
   - Analyzes git repository status, branches, commits, and large files
   - Calculates health score (0-100) based on multiple factors
   - Outputs JSON to `/api/git-health.json`

2. **Git Health Dashboard** (`/git-health.html`):
   - Health score with circular progress indicator (color-coded: green/yellow/red)
   - Current branch and tracking status with sync info (ahead/behind remote)
   - Last commit display with message, author, date, hash
   - Stats grid: total commits, uncommitted count, branches, stashes, repo size, warnings
   - Uncommitted files list with status badges (staged/modified/untracked)
   - Recent commits list (15 commits) with author and relative time
   - Warnings section detecting: detached HEAD, merge conflicts, uncommitted changes, stale repo, unpushed commits, behind remote, stash buildup
   - Stale branches list (merged or >30 days inactive)
   - Large files list (>500KB in working tree)
   - Repository info with remote URL
   - Export as JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card showing health score percentage
   - Command palette entry for navigation
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Status loader that updates the dashboard card with current health score
