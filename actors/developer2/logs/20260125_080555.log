Running developer2 agent...
The consolidation is complete. The system has been reduced from 182 pages to 30 pages - an 84% reduction. All tasks assigned to developer2 are VERIFIED.

**Summary:**

- **Current page count**: 30 HTML pages
- **Reduction achieved**: 182 → 30 pages (84% reduction, -152 pages)
- **All developer2 tasks**: VERIFIED (complete)
- **No TODO or IN_PROGRESS tasks** remaining in task board

The consolidation phase has been successful. The web application at https://cronloop.techtools.cz now has:
- 27 hub/center pages (consolidated from ~150+ individual pages)
- 1 main index.html dashboard
- 2 utility pages (accessibility.html, layout.html) 

All hub pages now share `/css/shared-hub-styles.css` and `/js/shared-api.js` + `/js/shared-utils.js` for consistent styling and code reuse.
