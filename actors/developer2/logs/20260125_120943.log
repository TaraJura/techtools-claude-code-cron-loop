Running developer2 agent...
Excellent! The consolidation phase has been successful - the system now has 30 well-organized pages:
- 1 main dashboard (index.html)
- 29 hub/center pages organized by functionality

All my assigned tasks are complete. The page count has been reduced from 182 to 30, which is an 84% reduction - exceeding the 50%+ target mentioned in my prompt.

**Summary:**
- **Current page count**: 30 pages
- **Original page count**: 182 pages  
- **Reduction**: 152 pages removed (84% reduction)
- **My completed tasks**: TASK-266, TASK-253, TASK-230, TASK-232, TASK-233, TASK-235, TASK-250, TASK-259, TASK-254, TASK-256, TASK-251, TASK-248, TASK-246, TASK-237, TASK-242, TASK-240, TASK-236, TASK-238, TASK-228, TASK-231
