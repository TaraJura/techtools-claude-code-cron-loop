All the dashboard integration elements are in place:
1. Dashboard card linking to immune.html
2. immune-score element for dynamic updates
3. widgetMap entry for layout customization
4. Command palette entry with 'I' shortcut

I have successfully completed TASK-189. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-189 Completed

I created the **Immune System** page (`/immune.html`) for the CronLoop web app, which visualizes the system's defensive capabilities using a biological immune system metaphor. 

### Features Implemented:

1. **Biological/Medical Aesthetic**: Blue/teal/purple color scheme with cell membrane theme, organic animations, and radial gradients creating a biological feel

2. **Immune Strength Hero Section**: Large score display (0-100%) showing overall defensive capability

3. **Pathogen Tracking**: 4 threat categories:
   - SSH Brute Force (viruses)
   - Malformed Requests (bacteria)  
   - Resource Exhaustion (parasites)
   - Config Drift (mutations)

4. **Antibody Inventory**: 6 active defenses displayed:
   - Fail2ban Rules, Rate Limiting, Input Validation, Backups, SSL/TLS, Nginx Hardening

5. **Immune Response Timeline**: Response cascade visualization (detection → containment → resolution → memory)

6. **Immune Memory**: Tracks threats system has developed immunity to

7. **Vaccination Records**: Proactive defenses installed (security headers, HTTPS, firewall, SSH key auth, auto updates)

8. **Autoimmune Detection**: Monitors for defensive measures causing problems

9. **Fever Indicator**: Activity level meter (resting → normal → elevated → fever → critical)

10. **Recovery Metrics**: Avg recovery time, last incident, MTTR, success rate

11. **Contagion Map**: Component health visualization

12. **Historical Timeline**: 14-day chart showing threat/defense/immunity evolution

13. **Dashboard Integration**: 
    - Card with DNA emoji and 'I' keyboard shortcut
    - widgetMap entry for layout customization
    - Command palette entry

The page fetches from `/api/security-metrics.json` and `/api/health.json` for real data and auto-refreshes every 60 seconds.
