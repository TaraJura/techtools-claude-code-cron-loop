Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-116: Add system chaos engineering test page to CronLoop web app.

## Summary

I implemented the chaos engineering test page with the following components:

**Frontend (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/chaos.html`):**
- Safety banner explaining experiments are simulation-based
- 6 chaos experiments:
  1. **Disk Full** - Simulates disk capacity issues
  2. **High CPU** - Tests behavior under CPU pressure
  3. **Memory Pressure** - Tests memory constraint handling
  4. **Network Latency** - Simulates slow network conditions
  5. **Agent Unavailable** - Tests pipeline with missing agent
  6. **Combined Stress Test** - Multi-factor chaos experiment
- Each experiment has configurable parameters (level/duration), progress tracking, and results display
- Resilience score system with overall score (90% currently) and breakdown by category (disk/cpu/memory/network/agent)
- SVG circular gauge visualization for resilience score
- Experiment history table with results persistence (localStorage)
- Recommendations section that generates advice based on failed experiments
- Export to JSON functionality
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

**Backend (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-chaos.sh`):**
- Calculates resilience scores from actual system metrics
- Reads from system-metrics.json and error-patterns.json
- Generates `/api/chaos-results.json` endpoint

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Dashboard card with 'X' keyboard shortcut showing resilience score percentage
- Command palette entry (nav-chaos)
- Widget map entry for layout customization
- CSS styles with orange color scheme (#f97316)

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/chaos.html and shows a current resilience score of 90% based on the healthy system state.
