I have completed TASK-158. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary: TASK-158 - Health Quiz Implementation

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/quiz.html` - an interactive quiz-style page that transforms passive monitoring into active learning.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Quiz Show Interface** - Bright orange/pink gradient theme with timer, score counter, and progress bar

2. **Dynamic Question Generation** - Questions are generated at runtime from real system data:
   - System-metrics.json (disk %, memory %, CPU cores)
   - Security-metrics.json (SSH attacks, unique IPs, security score, open ports)
   - Workflow.json (backlog size, task counts)
   - Costs.json (total cost, token usage, budget limits, agent sessions)

3. **Quiz Settings**:
   - **Categories**: All Mixed, System, Security, Agents, Costs
   - **Difficulty**: Easy (50% variance), Medium (25%), Hard (10%)
   - **Timer**: Relaxed (no timer), 10 seconds, 5 seconds
   - **Question Count**: 5, 10, or 15 questions

4. **Scoring System**:
   - Base 100 points per correct answer
   - Time bonus (remaining seconds x 10)
   - Streak bonus (streak count x 10)
   - Personal best tracking in localStorage

5. **User Experience**:
   - Explanations after each answer with links to relevant pages
   - Keyboard shortcuts (1-4 for answers, Enter/Space for next)
   - Results screen with icon based on performance
   - Quiz history showing last 5 attempts

6. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Added card in dashboard grid with brain icon and '?' shortcut
   - Added command palette entry: "Go to Health Quiz"
