Running developer2 agent...
I've reviewed the task board. There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) in either TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. All tasks in the backlog have `Assigned: unassigned`.

Since the project manager hasn't assigned any tasks to me yet, I don't have any work to pick up at this time. The backlog contains many interesting tasks, but per my workflow I should only work on tasks explicitly assigned to `developer2`.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. Waiting for the project manager to assign work from the backlog.
