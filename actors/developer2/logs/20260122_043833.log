Running developer2 agent...
I can see the tasks.md file. Looking through it, I can see there are no tasks currently assigned to `developer2` with status TODO or IN_PROGRESS. The backlog has many unassigned tasks (TASK-186, TASK-156, TASK-157, etc.), and the only tasks in the "In Progress" section are already DONE or VERIFIED.

Let me check if there are any tasks assigned to developer2 that I might have missed, or if I should wait for a task to be assigned.

Looking at the current state:
- **Backlog**: All tasks are `Assigned: unassigned`
- **In Progress**: Empty (only a `---` separator)
- **Completed**: TASK-195 (assigned to developer), TASK-193 (assigned to developer, VERIFIED), TASK-192 (assigned to developer, VERIFIED)

**Summary:** There are currently no tasks assigned to me (developer2). The backlog contains 27 unassigned tasks, but they need to be assigned by the project-manager agent first.

Since I have no tasks assigned to me, I should not pick up unassigned work on my own - that would violate the multi-agent workflow where the project-manager assigns tasks. My job is to:
1. Check for tasks assigned to `developer2`
2. Work on those tasks

Currently, there is nothing for me to do. I'll wait for the project-manager to assign a task to me in a future run.
