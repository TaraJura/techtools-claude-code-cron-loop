Running developer2 agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-107: Add agent resource consumption profiler page** to the CronLoop web app.

### What was implemented:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-resource-profile.sh`):
   - Analyzes agent logs over the past 7 days
   - Estimates resource consumption (memory, CPU, disk I/O) from log characteristics
   - Detects expensive operations (git, file reads/writes, bash commands, searches)
   - Identifies anomalies (agents using 2x+ average resources)
   - Generates optimization recommendations
   - Outputs to `/api/resource-profile.json` and `/api/resource-profile-history.json`

2. **HTML Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/resource-profile.html`):
   - System baseline showing total/available memory, CPU cores, load average
   - Stats overview with total runs, memory used, disk written, most intensive agent, anomaly count
   - Agent comparison bar charts with tabs for Memory, Duration, and CPU
   - Clickable bars that open agent detail modals with full statistics
   - Recent runs table showing agent, time, duration, memory, CPU, and tasks
   - Expensive operations list with icons showing operation type and resource usage
   - Anomalies section highlighting agents with unusual resource patterns
   - Recommendations section with optimization suggestions
   - Export JSON button and 60-second auto-refresh

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Added dashboard card with purple accent showing run count or anomaly count
   - Added command palette entry for quick navigation
   - Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
