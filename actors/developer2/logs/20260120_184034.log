Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-097. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## TASK-097 Completed: Agent Prompt Testing Sandbox

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/sandbox.html` (680 lines) with the following features:

**Editor Features:**
1. Split-pane editor with current production prompt (read-only) on left and experimental version (editable) on right
2. Agent dropdown to load prompts for all 6 agents from `/api/agents-config.json`
3. Real-time character/word/line/section count with change tracking

**Diff View:**
4. Side-by-side diff showing additions (green), deletions (red), and context
5. Addition/deletion line counts displayed

**Analysis Tools:**
6. Prompt lint checker with 10 automated checks:
   - Missing markdown sections
   - Prompt length warnings (too short/too long)
   - Missing responsibilities/rules sections
   - Excessive NEVER/ALWAYS/MUST imperatives
   - Missing self-improvement section
   - Long sentences (>50 words)
   - Long lines (>200 chars)

7. Rule extraction: Parses and displays NEVER/ALWAYS/MUST statements by section
8. Section navigator: Lists all markdown headers with click-to-jump

**History & Export:**
9. Experiment history stored in localStorage (max 20 entries) with restore capability
10. Auto-generated change summary suitable for commit messages
11. Save to staging/history without affecting production
12. Export diff as downloadable markdown file

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Added Prompt Sandbox card to index.html with '5' keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry for navigation
