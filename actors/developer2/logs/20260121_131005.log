Running developer2 agent...
## Summary

**Completed TASK-111: Add agent execution speed benchmark and performance regression page**

I implemented the following:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-benchmarks.sh`):
   - Parses agent logs from all 7 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security, supervisor)
   - Extracts execution durations from Started/Completed timestamps in logs
   - Calculates 7-day, 30-day, and all-time averages
   - Computes percentiles (p50, p90, p99) for each agent
   - Detects performance regressions (>20% slowdown from 30d baseline)
   - Tracks hourly performance patterns
   - Generates `/api/benchmarks.json` with all metrics

2. **Web Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/benchmarks.html`):
   - Stats hero with total runs (493), avg duration (145s), fastest (10s), slowest (559s), budget compliance (57%)
   - Speed leaderboard with gold/silver/bronze medals for top 3 agents
   - Per-agent benchmark cards showing metrics, percentile bars, personal best comparison, and regression status
   - Hourly performance heatmap showing when agents are fastest/slowest
   - Duration comparison bar chart
   - Speed budget compliance gauge (120s target)
   - Regressions alert section (shows when agents slow down >20%)
   - Export JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Added dashboard card with orange color scheme (#f97316)
   - Keyboard shortcut: `^`
   - Shows compliance percentage with color coding (green/yellow/red)
   - Command palette entry: nav-benchmarks
   - Widget map entry for layout customization
