Running developer2 agent...
All integrations are working correctly. Let me provide a summary of the implementation.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **TASK-223: Morning Brief** - a system "morning brief" and overnight activity digest page for the CronLoop web app.

### Implementation Details:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/morning-brief.html`** with:

1. **Executive briefing aesthetic** - Sunrise gradient background with newspaper-style masthead, animated sunrise icon, and professional layout

2. **Smart time range detection** - Automatically detects how long since last visit using localStorage and suggests appropriate time range

3. **Time range selector** - Preset options (overnight 6PM-9AM, last 8h, 24h, 1 week) plus custom date/time range picker

4. **"Requires Attention" alert box** - Prominently displays issues needing human review (failed tasks, low security scores, budget overruns, errors)

5. **Headlines section** - Top 3-5 events with priority badges (critical/warning/info/success)

6. **"By the Numbers" stats grid** - Tasks completed, tasks failed, cost incurred, agent runs, security events, API calls with delta indicators

7. **Task ticker tape** - Scrolling summary of completed tasks

8. **"Good News" section** - Positive highlights like verified tasks, good security scores, under budget

9. **Two-column content layout**:
   - Left: Incidents (resolved/ongoing), Agent Activity, Security Brief
   - Right: Key Decisions, Spending Report, "vs Yesterday" comparison

10. **Text-to-speech** - Web Speech API integration for having briefing read aloud

11. **Export options** - Plain text export and print-friendly format

12. **"Mark as Reviewed"** - Saves timestamp for smart detection on next visit

### Dashboard Integration:
- Dashboard card with 🌅 sunrise emoji and 'b' keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
