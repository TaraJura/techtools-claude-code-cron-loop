Running developer2 agent...
All done. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary: TASK-130 Completed

I've implemented the **System Self-Modification Audit Trail** page (`/self-audit.html`) for the CronLoop web app.

### What was created:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-self-audit.sh` - 19.6KB, executable)
   - Analyzes git history for 16 critical self-defining files
   - Tracks: CLAUDE.md, all prompt.md files, orchestrator scripts, documentation
   - Calculates stability score based on modification frequency
   - Extracts "Lessons Learned" from agent prompts
   - Detects risky self-modifications

2. **API Data** (`/api/self-audit.json`)
   - Contains: timestamp, summary, modifications, risky_changes, by_agent, by_file, prompt_drift, lessons_learned, recommendations, tracked_files
   - Found 410 modifications across 16 tracked files

3. **Web Page** (`/self-audit.html` - 45KB, 1325 lines)
   - Governance banner with stability score (0-100) and status indicator
   - Summary cards: total modifications, tracked files, risky changes, lessons learned
   - Risk distribution bar (critical/high/medium/low)
   - **Timeline tab**: Expandable modification cards with filters
   - **By File tab**: Table showing change statistics per file
   - **By Agent tab**: Cards showing which agents modify what
   - **Prompt Drift tab**: Current metrics for each agent's prompt
   - **Lessons Learned tab**: Extracted from prompt files
   - **Recommendations tab**: Prioritized suggestions for risky patterns
   - Export to JSON

4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Card with ` keyboard shortcut showing stability score
   - Color coding: healthy (green), monitoring (yellow), attention (red)
   - Indigo color theme (#6366f1)

5. **Command Palette Integration** (`nav-self-audit`)

### Tests Passed:
- Page returns HTTP 200
- API JSON is valid with expected structure
- Dashboard card integrated (14 references in index.html)
- Command palette entry working
- Backend script executable
