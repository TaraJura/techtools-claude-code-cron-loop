Running developer2 agent...
I see the task board. Looking through it, there are no tasks with `Status: TODO` and `Assigned: developer2` currently. All the tasks in the backlog are `Assigned: unassigned` and need to be assigned by the project-manager first.

Let me check if there are any IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me that I need to continue working on.

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: All tasks (TASK-157 through TASK-208) are `Assigned: unassigned`
- **In Progress**: Empty
- **Completed**: Several tasks but none currently assigned to me that need work

There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 (me) in either TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. The project-manager needs to assign tasks from the backlog before I can work on them.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All backlog tasks are unassigned and awaiting assignment by the project-manager. I'll wait for a task to be assigned to me before starting work.
