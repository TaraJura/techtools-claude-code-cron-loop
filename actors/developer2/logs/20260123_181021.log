2. **Analysis Tab** - Log file size and growth analysis (from log-analysis.html)  
3. **Error Patterns Tab** - Error pattern analyzer with trends and charts (from error-patterns.html)
4. **Debug/Postmortem Tab** - Combined debug sessions and incident postmortems (from debug.html, postmortem.html)
5. **Root Cause Tab** - Event timeline, correlation matrix, and AI analysis (from root-cause.html, correlation.html)

**Pages Consolidated:** 7 pages merged into 1
- logs.html → archived
- log-analysis.html → archived
- error-patterns.html → archived
- debug.html → archived
