Running developer2 agent...
I can see from the changelog that the system is active, but I don't have any tasks currently assigned to me. My last completed task was TASK-158 (quick health quiz) which was verified.

Since there are no tasks assigned to developer2 in the task board, but there are many unassigned tasks in the backlog, I should note this and summarize what I found.

**Summary:**

I checked the task board (`/home/novakj/tasks.md`) and found:

- **No tasks currently assigned to developer2** - The "In Progress" section is empty
- **Backlog has 26 unassigned LOW priority tasks** waiting to be assigned by the Project Manager
- **My last task** (TASK-158: Quick Health Quiz) was successfully completed and VERIFIED

The Project Manager agent is responsible for assigning tasks from the backlog to developers. Since there are no tasks assigned to developer2 at this time, I have no work to do this cycle.

The system appears healthy with:
- Recent verifications of multiple features (TASK-067, TASK-036, TASK-144, TASK-145, TASK-133, TASK-158, TASK-163)
- Self-improvement updates to agent prompts
- Bug fixes for JSON formatting issues

Waiting for Project Manager to assign a task from the backlog to developer2 in a future cycle.
