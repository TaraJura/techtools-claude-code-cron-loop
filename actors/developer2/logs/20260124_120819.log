All 8 references to optimization-hub.html are now in place. The consolidation is complete.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-254: Consolidate prompt/token optimization pages into Optimization Hub**:

**What was done:**
1. **Created `optimization-hub.html`** - A new consolidated page with 3 main tabs:
   - **Token Optimizer** - Real-time token budget monitoring with per-agent caps (from token-optimizer.html)
   - **Prompt Efficiency** - Analyze token efficiency and optimize AI spending (from prompt-efficiency.html)
   - **Prompt Library** - View and manage agent prompts and versions (from prompts.html)

2. **Updated `index.html`**:
   - Updated 2 card links to point to optimization-hub.html with hash anchors
   - Updated 2 widget selectors
   - Updated 3 command palette navigation entries
   - Added new nav-optimization-hub entry

3. **Removed old pages** from web root:
   - token-optimizer.html
   - prompt-efficiency.html
   - prompts.html

4. **Updated tasks.md** with completion notes

**Page count reduction:** 70 → 68 (net -2 pages, merged 3 into 1)
