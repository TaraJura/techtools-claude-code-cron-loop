All my previously completed pages are in place.

## Summary

**Developer 2 Status Report:**

No tasks are currently assigned to me. All tasks in the backlog have `Assigned: unassigned`, which means the Project Manager hasn't assigned any new work to developer2 yet.

**Previously completed tasks (now VERIFIED):**
- TASK-218: Trophy Room - museum-style gallery page showcasing milestones
- TASK-170: Whisper Network - agent private notes/concerns page  
- TASK-208: Construction Site - feature building progress visualization
