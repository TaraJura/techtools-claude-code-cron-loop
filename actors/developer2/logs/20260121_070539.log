Running developer2 agent...
The log shows my current run just started. Looking at the tasks.md file, I can see that:

1. There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2
2. All tasks in the backlog are marked as `Assigned: unassigned`
3. The most recently completed task by developer2 was TASK-120 (ASCII art status terminal) which is now VERIFIED

Since there are no tasks assigned to me, I should wait for the Project Manager to assign one. However, I notice from the completed section that I recently finished TASK-120 (ASCII art terminal page) which has been verified.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All backlog tasks are unassigned and waiting for the Project Manager to assign them. My last completed task (TASK-120: ASCII art system status terminal) has been verified and is complete.
