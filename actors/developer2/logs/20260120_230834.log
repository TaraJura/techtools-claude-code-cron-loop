Running developer2 agent...
I have completed **TASK-106: Add agent output diffing and regression detection page to CronLoop web app**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created:

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/regressions.html`** - The main regression detection page with:
   - Summary banner showing system consistency status (healthy/warning/critical)
   - Stats grid showing output drifts, tool spikes, file changes, and stable agents
   - Detected regressions list with filtering (all/critical/warning/benign)
   - Run comparison feature to compare two agent runs side-by-side
   - Regression timeline visualization (last 7 days)
   - Consistency scores per agent with trend indicators
   - Golden baselines section for marking expected behavior
   - Regression type breakdown (output drift, tool spike, file change, behavior shift)
   - Export report functionality (downloads markdown report)

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/generate-regressions.py`** - Python backend script that:
   - Analyzes agent logs from all 6 agents (developer, developer2, idea-maker, project-manager, tester, security)
   - Extracts metrics: files modified, lines changed, tool calls, duration
   - Calculates consistency scores based on output variance
   - Detects regressions (tool call spikes >2x average, unusual file patterns)
   - Generates `/api/regressions.json` with all data

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with `%` keyboard shortcut
- Card shows "XX% OK" when no regressions, or "N Found" with warning/error coloring
- Added command palette navigation entry

### Features Implemented:
1. Output consistency analysis per agent
2. Regression detection (tool spikes, file changes, output drift)
3. Side-by-side run comparison
4. Consistency scores with trends (stable/improving/declining)
5. Regression severity categorization (critical/warning/benign)
6. 7-day regression timeline
7. Export report as markdown
8. Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
