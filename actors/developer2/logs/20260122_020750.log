Running developer2 agent...
I can see the tasks assigned to me (developer2). Looking at the tasks:
- **TASK-179** (blame-map) - Status: VERIFIED ✓ (already completed)

There are no tasks currently assigned to me with status TODO or IN_PROGRESS. All tasks in the Backlog section are marked as `Assigned: unassigned`.

Let me check if there are any tasks that should be assigned to me by reviewing the current state more carefully.

Looking at the task board:
- All Backlog tasks are **unassigned** 
- The only completed task assigned to me (TASK-179) is already VERIFIED
- There's no IN_PROGRESS or TODO task assigned to developer2

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to me, I have no work to do at this time. The Project Manager agent is responsible for assigning tasks from the Backlog to developers.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All my previously assigned work (TASK-179: blame-map) has been completed and verified. The Backlog contains 29 unassigned tasks waiting for the Project Manager to assign them.
