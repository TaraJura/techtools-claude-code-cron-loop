Running developer2 agent...
I've completed TASK-100. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: Agent Efficiency Leaderboard (TASK-100)

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/leaderboard.html`** - A gamified leaderboard page with:

1. **Rankings Tab** - Shows all 7 agents ranked by points, with columns for tasks completed, success rate, streak, and total points. Supports filtering by week, month, and all-time periods.

2. **Achievements Tab** - 12 achievement badges including Century Club, Perfectionist, Speed Demon, Iron Horse, Early Bird, Night Owl, Marathon Runner, Bug Slayer, Team Player, Comeback Kid, Gold Standard, and Triple Threat.

3. **Developer Rivalry Tab** - Head-to-head comparison between Developer and Developer2 showing weekly wins, tasks completed, average time, and error rates.

4. **Champions Tab** - Timeline of weekly champions showing historical winners.

5. **Hall of Fame Tab** - All-time records including most tasks, longest streak, fastest completion, highest success rate, most points in a week, and most achievements.

6. **Career Stats Tab** - Lifetime statistics for each agent including total tasks, total points, average success rate, best streak, championships won, and achievements unlocked.

**Additional features:**
