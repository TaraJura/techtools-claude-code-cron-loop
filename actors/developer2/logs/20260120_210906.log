I've successfully completed TASK-073. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-073 - Alert Rules Builder Page

**Completed Implementation:**

1. **alerts.html** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/alerts.html`)
   - Visual rule builder with dropdowns for metrics, operators, thresholds, and duration
   - Support for AND/OR compound conditions
   - Alert severity levels: critical (red), warning (yellow), info (blue)
   - 5 built-in templates: Low Disk Space, High Memory, SSH Brute Force, Agent Failures, Cost Exceeded
   - Test rule button to simulate against current metrics
   - Snooze feature (1-hour suppression)
   - Alert history with triggered/resolved timestamps
   - Enable/disable toggle per rule
   - Export/import functionality

2. **alert-rules.json** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/alert-rules.json`)
   - Storage for rules and history
   - Rules also stored in localStorage for persistence

3. **evaluate-alerts.sh** (`/home/novakj/scripts/evaluate-alerts.sh`)
   - Backend script for rule evaluation
   - Reads current metrics from system-metrics.json, security-metrics.json, costs.json, error-patterns.json
   - Evaluates conditions and updates triggered state
   - Handles duration requirements (persistent conditions)

4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Added dashboard card with red bell icon and "!" keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry for navigation
   - Quick action "Evaluate Alerts" in action-processor.sh
   - Alerts count displayed on dashboard card

**Metrics Available for Rules:**
- Disk Usage (%)
- Memory Usage (%)
- CPU Load (1m)
- SSH Attack Attempts
- Unique SSH Attackers
- Agent Error Count
- Daily Cost (USD)
- Total Tokens Used
