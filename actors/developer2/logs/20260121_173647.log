Everything is working. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-010: Create a network connectivity tester** for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was implemented:

### Backend Script
- Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-connectivity.sh` that:
  - Pings external hosts (8.8.8.8 Google DNS, 1.1.1.1 Cloudflare DNS, 9.9.9.9 Quad9 DNS)
  - Tests DNS resolution for domains (google.com, cloudflare.com, github.com, anthropic.com)
  - Checks gateway reachability and latency
  - Reports overall connectivity status (healthy/warning/critical)
  - Outputs to `/api/connectivity.json` and tracks history in `/api/connectivity-history.json`

### Web Page Updates (network.html)
- Added a new **Connectivity Tests** section at the top of the page with:
  - Overall status indicator with average latency
  - External Host Ping card showing ping results to 3 DNS servers with latency
  - DNS Resolution card showing resolution time for 4 domains
  - Gateway info card showing default gateway IP and reachability
  - DNS servers display

### Dashboard Integration
- Added **Network dashboard card** with:
  - Cyan-colored icon showing connectivity status
  - Displays average latency when healthy, "Partial" for warnings, "Down" for critical
  - Keyboard shortcut '4' to navigate
- Updated **command palette** entry with enhanced description
- Added **widgetMap** entry for layout customization

### Task Status
- Marked TASK-010 as DONE in tasks.md and moved to Completed section
