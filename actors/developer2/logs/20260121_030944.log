Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-125: Agent Dependency Impact Analyzer.

## Summary

I implemented the **Dependency Impact Analyzer** page for the CronLoop web app:

### What was created:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-impact-analyzer.sh`):
   - Analyzes HTML->API dependencies (by parsing `fetch()` calls)
   - Analyzes Script->API dependencies (by parsing `OUTPUT_FILE` patterns)
   - Analyzes Agent Prompt->Config dependencies (by parsing references in prompt.md files)
   - Calculates risk levels based on number of dependents
   - Identifies fragile dependencies (high churn + many dependents)
   - Generates decoupling suggestions for highly coupled files
   - Outputs to `/api/impact-analysis.json`

2. **Web Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/impact.html`):
   - Coupling score banner showing system-wide coupling metric
   - Summary cards for components, dependencies, and risk distribution
   - Risk distribution bar with color-coded segments
   - "What-If Analysis" panel: select any file to see its blast radius
   - 5 tabbed views: High Impact Files, Fragile Dependencies, Decoupling Suggestions, All Components, All Dependencies
   - Filtering and sorting for components (by type, risk, dependents/dependencies/churn)
   - Export to JSON for each view
   - Orange theme (#f97316) matching the "impact/warning" aesthetic

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with `I` keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry (`nav-impact`)
   - Widget map entry for layout customization
   - Data loader showing coupling score on the card

### Key Metrics Found:
- 170 total components tracked
- 262 dependencies mapped
- 4 critical risk files (10+ dependents)
- 20 high-impact files (5+ dependents)
- Coupling score: 3.08 (healthy range)
