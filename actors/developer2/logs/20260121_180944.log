The task has been completed. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-155: Add system "diff radar" and change detection overlay page**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-diff-radar.sh`):
   - Aggregates changes from multiple sources: git commits, config drift, security events, and task completions
   - Calculates change velocity (changes per hour) for different time periods
   - Generates API JSON with summary statistics and detailed change list
   - Tracks history for trend analysis

2. **API Endpoint** (`/api/diff-radar.json`):
   - Summary with change counts (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d) and velocity metrics
   - Category breakdown (file, config, metric, security, task)
   - Detailed changes array with type, path, timestamp, age, and metadata

3. **HTML Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/diff-radar.html`):
   - Circular radar sweep animation with CSS
   - Blips positioned by recency (newer = closer to center) and category (quadrants)
   - Color-coded categories: blue (files), orange (config), green (metrics), red (security), purple (tasks)
   - Time selector buttons: 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days
   - Blip clustering for related changes with count badges
   - Click to see change details in modal
   - Legend with category toggles
   - "What's new since I left" bookmark feature (localStorage)
   - Export as JSON
   - Recent changes list panel
   - Stats grid showing counts by time period
   - Audio ping toggle for new changes
   - Center indicator showing velocity
   - 30-second auto-refresh

4. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with 'd' keyboard shortcut showing 24h change count
   - Command palette entry for quick navigation
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Data loader function to populate the card
