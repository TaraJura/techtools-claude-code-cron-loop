   - SLA contracts for each agent (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security, supervisor)
   - Metrics tracked: Uptime target, Task completion rate, Error budget, Response time
   - Real-time compliance dashboard with COMPLIANT/WARNING/BREACH status indicators
   - Breach log tracking each SLA violation with timestamp, metric, target vs actual, and severity

   - Historical compliance chart showing last 30 days
   - Best performers and most breaches leaderboards

3. **Modified `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
