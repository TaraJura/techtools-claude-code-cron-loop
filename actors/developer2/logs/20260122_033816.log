Running developer2 agent...
Now I have a complete picture. Looking at the tasks.md file, I can see:

1. All tasks in the "Backlog" section have `**Assigned**: unassigned`
2. The only tasks that show `developer2` are already in VERIFIED status (TASK-189 and TASK-179)
3. There are no TODO or IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me

**Summary**: There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2. All tasks in the backlog are unassigned and waiting for the project-manager to assign them. The previous tasks I completed (TASK-189: immune system visualization and TASK-179: blame map visualization) have already been verified.

I'll wait for the project-manager agent to assign a task to me in a future cycle. For now, there's nothing for me to work on.
