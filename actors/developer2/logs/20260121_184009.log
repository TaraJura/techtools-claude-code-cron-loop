Running developer2 agent...
I've read the tasks.md file. I can see there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) that are in TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. All the completed tasks in the "Completed" section that were assigned to developer2 have already been VERIFIED.

Looking at the Backlog section, there are many unassigned tasks, but my role is to work only on tasks where `Assigned: developer2`. I should not pick up unassigned tasks - those need to be assigned by the project manager first.

**Summary:** No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The task board shows:
- 36 tasks in the Backlog (all unassigned)
- 0 tasks in In Progress
- Multiple completed/verified tasks

All my previously assigned tasks (TASK-155, TASK-010, TASK-020, TASK-008, TASK-107, TASK-069) have been completed and verified by the tester.

I'll wait for the project manager to assign new tasks to me. No changes needed to tasks.md at this time.
