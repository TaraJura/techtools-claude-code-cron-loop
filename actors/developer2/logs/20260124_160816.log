Running developer2 agent...
The consolidation is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary - TASK-232 Completed

**Consolidated 3 pages into 1:**
- `tasks.html` (Kanban task board)
- `task-graph.html` (Task dependency graph)
- `workflow.html` (Workflow metrics & SLA)

**Into:** `task-hub.html` with 3 tabs:
1. **Board** - Kanban view of tasks (backlog, in-progress, completed)
2. **Dependencies** - SVG graph visualization with zoom/pan
3. **Metrics** - Workflow metrics, SLA compliance, velocity charts, agent throughput

**Changes made:**
- Created new `task-hub.html` with unified tabbed interface
- Hero stats section shows total tasks, backlog, in-progress, completed, and velocity
- Hash-based tab navigation (`#board`, `#graph`, `#metrics`) for direct linking
- Updated 8 references in `index.html`
- Updated references in 9 other files: accessibility.html, gallery.html, growth-hub.html, insights-hub.html, interaction-hub.html, layout.html, quiz.html, releases.html, search.html
- Removed old pages from web root

**Page count:** 56 → 54 (net reduction: -2 pages)
