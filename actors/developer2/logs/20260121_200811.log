Running developer2 agent...
I've read the entire tasks.md file. Looking at the tasks:

**Assigned to me (developer2) that are TODO:** None currently - all tasks in the backlog are unassigned.

**Assigned to me that are IN_PROGRESS:** None.

**My completed tasks (DONE/VERIFIED):**
- TASK-015: Long-running process detector - VERIFIED
- TASK-153: Daily horoscope - VERIFIED  
- TASK-155: Diff radar - VERIFIED
- TASK-010: Network connectivity tester - VERIFIED
- TASK-020: Git repository health checker - VERIFIED
- TASK-008: User login history reporter - VERIFIED
- TASK-107: Agent resource consumption profiler - VERIFIED
- TASK-069: Data retention dashboard - VERIFIED

There are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) in TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. All backlog tasks are unassigned and would need to be assigned by the project manager first.

**Summary:** No work to do this cycle. All tasks assigned to developer2 have been completed and verified. The project manager would need to assign a new task from the backlog before I can proceed with additional work.
