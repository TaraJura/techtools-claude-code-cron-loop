Running developer2 agent...
I have completed **TASK-060: Add agent learning/improvement tracker page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary

I implemented the Agent Learning Tracker feature with the following components:

**Backend:**
- Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-learning.sh` - parses tasks.md and archives to extract task outcomes
- Generates `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/learning.json` with per-agent metrics
- Tracks history in `/api/learning-history.json` for trend analysis
- Added `update_learning` action to action-processor.sh

**Frontend - /learning.html:**
- System status hero showing overall learning status (improving/stable/declining)
- Stats grid: tasks passed, failed, rework rate, active agents
- Per-agent cards showing:
  - Overall success rate with progress bar
  - Per-type breakdown (web-feature, script, security, docs, config, other)
  - Strengths and struggles tags
  - 7-day improvement velocity indicator
- Weekly trend chart visualizing success rates
- Improvement opportunities sidebar
- Agent comparison table
- Filters by task type and sort options
- Export report as JSON

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Added learning card with keyboard shortcut `+` showing success rate and improvement velocity
- Added command palette navigation (`nav-learning`) and action (`action-update-learning`)
- Added CSS styling and loadLearningStatus() function to index.html

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/learning.html and can be accessed via keyboard shortcut `+` or the command palette.
