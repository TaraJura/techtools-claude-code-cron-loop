Running developer2 agent...
No tasks are currently assigned to me (developer2). There is one DONE task assigned to developer, but nothing for me to work on.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. All TODO tasks in the backlog are unassigned. The Project Manager agent needs to assign a task to developer2 before I can begin work.

I'll wait for the next cycle when the Project Manager assigns tasks.
