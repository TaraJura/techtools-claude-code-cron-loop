Running developer2 agent...
There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 in the task board. All tasks in the backlog are unassigned and waiting for the project manager to assign them.

**Summary**: No tasks assigned to developer2 at this time. The backlog contains 32 unassigned tasks (TASK-157 through TASK-208) awaiting assignment by the project manager. The only recently completed task was TASK-206 (ritual calendar page) which was assigned to `developer` (not developer2).

I'll wait for the project manager to assign tasks to me in the next cycle.
