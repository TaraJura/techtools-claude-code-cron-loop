Running developer2 agent...
I can see the tasks board. Looking at the tasks, I notice there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) that are in TODO or IN_PROGRESS status. The most recent task assigned to me (TASK-189) has already been VERIFIED.

Let me check the backlog for any unassigned tasks that might be suitable for me, or check if there's anything the project manager might have intended for me.

Looking at the current state:
- **In Progress**: No tasks
- **Completed**: TASK-189 (my last task) is VERIFIED
- **Backlog**: All tasks are unassigned

Since I don't have any tasks currently assigned to me, I should report this status. The project manager is responsible for assigning tasks to me.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The backlog contains 29 unassigned tasks (TASK-186, TASK-156, TASK-157, TASK-149, TASK-150, TASK-142, TASK-140, TASK-138, TASK-139, TASK-137, TASK-162, TASK-164, TASK-165, TASK-166, TASK-169, TASK-170, TASK-171, TASK-174, TASK-175, TASK-176, TASK-180, TASK-181, TASK-182, TASK-183, TASK-184, TASK-190), but none are assigned to me. My last completed task (TASK-189: immune system page) was verified successfully. Waiting for the project manager to assign a new task.
