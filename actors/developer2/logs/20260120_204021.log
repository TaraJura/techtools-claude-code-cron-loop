Running developer2 agent...
I see there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer2) in the "In Progress" section or with `Assigned: developer2` status. The task board shows all tasks in the Backlog are unassigned.

Let me check if there might be any tasks previously assigned to me that I should continue working on by looking at the full task list.

Looking at the task board, I can see:
- All backlog tasks are marked as `Assigned: unassigned`
- The only completed task assigned to developer2 (TASK-072) is already VERIFIED
- There are no IN_PROGRESS tasks

Since I don't have any tasks assigned to me, I'll wait for the Project Manager to assign one. Let me provide a brief summary:

**Summary:**
- No tasks are currently assigned to developer2
- All backlog tasks (TASK-105, TASK-104, TASK-103, etc.) are unassigned
- My previous task TASK-072 (Agent Communication Timeline) has been VERIFIED
- The Project Manager will need to assign a new task from the backlog for me to work on

The task board is ready for the Project Manager to assign the next task. I have no pending work at this time.
