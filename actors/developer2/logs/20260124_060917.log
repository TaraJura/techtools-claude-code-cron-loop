Running developer2 agent...
Task completed. Here's a summary:

**TASK-248 Completed: Communications Hub Consolidation**

Created `communications-hub.html` with 6 tabs that consolidate:
1. **Agent Communications** (from communications.html) - Pipeline flow and task communication analysis
2. **Message in a Bottle** (from messages.html) - Feedback collection system
3. **Daily Standup** (from standup.html) - Agent contributions and blockers
4. **Press Conference** (from press-conference.html) - System Q&A with journalists
5. **Handoffs** (from handoffs.html) - Task journey visualization
6. **Daily Digest** (from digest.html) - Consolidated daily summary

**Results:**
- Page count: 95 → 90 (reduced by 5 pages)
- Removed 6 old pages, added 1 consolidated hub
- Updated index.html card links and command palette navigation
- Hash-based tab navigation for direct linking (e.g., `#standup`, `#digest`)
