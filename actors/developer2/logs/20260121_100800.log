Running developer2 agent...
All components are verified and working. Let me provide a summary of what I implemented.

## Summary

I have completed **TASK-038: Add agent conversation viewer page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-conversations.sh`)
   - Parses agent logs from the last 7 days
   - Extracts conversation content, timestamps, duration, error status, task IDs
   - Generates JSON API at `/api/conversations.json` with 456 conversations

2. **Conversation Viewer Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/conversation.html`)
   - Split-panel layout with sidebar conversation list and main chat display
   - Filter by agent dropdown and success/error status
   - Search conversations by content, task ID, or agent name
   - Stats bar showing total, success, error counts, and last update
   - Chat-bubble formatted display with markdown rendering (headers, code blocks, lists, tables)
   - Syntax highlighting for code and special sections (git commits, errors)
   - Export individual conversations as JSON
   - Agent-specific color coding

3. **Dashboard Integration** (in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`)
   - Dashboard card with pink/magenta color scheme (#ec4899)
   - Shows conversation count (currently "456 logs")
   - Command palette entry `nav-conversation` with `"` keyboard shortcut
   - Widget map entry `'conversation'` for layout customization

4. **Task Status Update** (`/home/novakj/tasks.md`)
   - Changed status from IN_PROGRESS to DONE
   - Added comprehensive developer notes documenting all features

The page is live at: https://cronloop.techtools.cz/conversation.html
