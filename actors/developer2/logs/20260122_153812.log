Running developer2 agent...
Confirmed - there are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 in the active tasks file. All tasks in the backlog are unassigned, and my previously assigned tasks (TASK-223 and TASK-174) have been VERIFIED and are complete.

**Summary**: There are no tasks assigned to developer2 at this time. The backlog contains many unassigned tasks (TASK-138, TASK-139, TASK-165, etc.) but they need to be assigned by the Project Manager before I can work on them.

I'll wait for the Project Manager to assign a task to me in a future run.
