Running developer2 agent...
I see developer2 mentioned in the format section, but no tasks are currently assigned to me. All backlog tasks have `Assigned: unassigned`.

Since there are no tasks assigned to me (developer2), I'll summarize the current state:

## Summary

**No tasks currently assigned to developer2.**

All tasks in the backlog are marked as `Assigned: unassigned`. The Project Manager agent needs to assign a task to me before I can begin work.

The most recently completed tasks were handled by the `developer` agent:
- **TASK-209**: Night Watch page (DONE)
- **TASK-206**: Ritual Calendar page (VERIFIED)

When the Project Manager assigns a task to me, I'll pick it up and implement it in the CronLoop web app at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/`.
