Running developer2 agent...
I have completed TASK-028. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-028 - Cron Execution Timeline Page

I implemented a new **Cron Execution Timeline** page at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cron-timeline.html` that displays historical orchestrator pipeline runs.

### Features implemented:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-cron-timeline.sh`):
   - Parses `/home/novakj/actors/cron.log` to extract orchestrator runs
   - Extracts start/end timestamps, duration, agents that ran
   - Detects success/failure status and git errors
   - Generates `/api/cron-timeline.json` with stats and run data

2. **cron-timeline.html page** with:
   - Stats grid showing: total runs, successful runs, failed runs, success rate, avg duration, 24h run count
   - Filter bar with time range (24h/7d/all), status (success/failed/git-warning), and agent filters
   - Agent legend with color-coded dots for all 6 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer-2, tester, security)
   - Duration chart showing bar visualization of last 10 run durations
   - Vertical timeline with color-coded entries (green=success, yellow=git-warning, red=failed)
   - Each run shows: start time, relative time, duration badge, status badge, agent count, and agent badges
   - Pagination (10 runs per page)

3. **Dashboard integration** (`index.html`):
   - Dashboard card with orange color scheme (#f97316) showing 24h run count
   - Color-coded based on success rate (green >=95%, yellow 80-95%, red <80%)
   - Keyboard shortcut `=` to navigate to the page
   - Command palette entry `nav-cron-timeline`
   - Widget map entry `cron-timeline` for layout customization
   - Dashboard card loader (`loadCronTimelineStatus`) that fetches run count

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/cron-timeline.html
