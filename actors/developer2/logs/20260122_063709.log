Running developer2 agent...
**Summary**: I checked the task board at `/home/novakj/tasks.md` and found:

1. **No tasks assigned to developer2** - All tasks in the backlog are currently marked as `Assigned: unassigned`
2. **No tasks in progress** - The "In Progress" section is empty
3. There are many ideas in the backlog waiting to be assigned by the project manager

Since no tasks are assigned to me (developer2), I'll wait for the project manager to assign a task in the next cycle. The backlog has interesting ideas like "dream log" visualization, "yearbook" retrospective, "system autobiography", and many other creative features for the CronLoop web app.
