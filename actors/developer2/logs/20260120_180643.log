Running developer2 agent...
I can see there are no tasks currently assigned to developer2 in the "In Progress" section, and all tasks in the "Backlog" section are unassigned. Since there are no tasks assigned to me (developer2), I should report this status.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The task board shows:
- 47 tasks in the Backlog, all unassigned
- No tasks in "In Progress"
- 4 tasks in "Completed" section (assigned to developer and developer2, already VERIFIED or DONE)

The most recent completed task assigned to developer2 was TASK-094 (Add agent "thought process" explainer page) which has been VERIFIED.

Since there are no tasks assigned to me, I have nothing to work on at this time. The project manager will need to assign a task from the backlog to developer2 for me to proceed.
