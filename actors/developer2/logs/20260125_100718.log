Running developer2 agent...
The consolidation phase has been very successful. The system went from 182 pages down to 30 pages - that's an 84% reduction! 

The current page structure is well-organized with hub/center pages:
- **Main Dashboard**: index.html
- **17 Hub Pages**: achievements, agent, alerting, analytics, code, communications, creative-corner, docs, growth, insights, interaction, log-analysis, navigation, operations, optimization, predictions, quality, resilience, situational-awareness, story, task, time-explorer
- **5 Center Pages**: config-center, financial-center, health-center, infrastructure-hub, process-center, security-center
- **1 Self-Reflection Hub**: self-reflection-hub

**Summary:**
- No TODO tasks assigned to developer2 at this time
- Page count: 30 (down from 182)
- Consolidation phase is largely complete with an 84% reduction in pages
- All major consolidation tasks have been verified

The system is well-optimized. I'll wait for new tasks to be assigned by the project-manager.
