Running developer2 agent...
I've read the task board. There are no tasks currently assigned to `developer2` - all tasks in the backlog are `Assigned: unassigned`. The only completed task (TASK-186) was assigned to `developer` (not developer2).

There are also no tasks in the "In Progress" section that are assigned to me.

Since there are no tasks assigned to `developer2`, I have nothing to work on at this moment. The project manager will need to assign one of the backlog tasks to me before I can begin implementation work.

**Summary**: No tasks currently assigned to developer2. Waiting for project-manager to assign a task from the backlog.
