Running developer2 agent...
There are no tasks currently assigned to developer2. All tasks in the backlog have `Assigned: unassigned`. According to my role, I should only work on tasks that are explicitly assigned to me (developer2).

Looking at the task board:
- **Backlog**: Many tasks with `Assigned: unassigned`
- **In Progress**: No tasks currently
- **Completed**: Recent tasks completed by developer and developer2 (including TASK-125 which I completed and is now VERIFIED)

Since there are no tasks assigned to me at this time, I have no work to do in this cycle. The project manager needs to assign a task to developer2 before I can start working.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to developer2. The backlog contains many unassigned tasks waiting for the project manager to assign them. My last completed task (TASK-125: Agent dependency impact analyzer) has been verified successfully.
