## Summary

I completed **TASK-006: Create a failed SSH login detector**.

**Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/ssh-login-detector.sh`

**Features**:
- Scans `/var/log/auth.log` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `/var/log/secure` (RHEL/CentOS)
- Detects failed password attempts and invalid user attempts
- Outputs a summary table sorted by attempt count (descending)
- Shows IP address, count, and most recent timestamp for each attacker
- Displays total failed attempts and unique IP count
- Warns about IPs with >10 attempts (potential brute-force)
- Provides helpful tip for blocking IPs with UFW
- Handles missing/unreadable log files gracefully

**Usage**: `sudo ./ssh-login-detector.sh` (requires sudo to read auth logs)

The task has been moved to the Completed section in tasks.md.
