Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-129. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-129 Completed: Agent Communication Log and Inter-Agent Messaging Page

I implemented the `/communications.html` page for the CronLoop web app with the following components:

### Backend Script (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-communications.sh`)
- Parses agent logs to extract read/write patterns for each agent
- Tracks what information each agent reads from tasks.md vs writes to it
- Analyzes handoffs between agents to calculate "signal clarity" scores
- Detects communication anti-patterns: missing info, vague specs, multiple retries
- Generates recommendations for improving inter-agent communication

### Web Page (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/communications.html`)
- **Summary Banner**: Shows average signal clarity score (72.5% on initial analysis)
- **Stats Cards**: Tasks analyzed (111), total handoffs (359), active agents, recommendations
- **Pipeline Flow Tab**: Interactive agent pipeline visualization with clarity percentages between agents
- **Task Timelines Tab**: Filterable list of task communication flows with expandable details
- **Agent Stats Tab**: Per-agent metrics including tasks touched, avg reads/writes, common patterns
- **Recommendations Tab**: Prioritized suggestions for improving communication quality
- **Export**: JSON and CSV export functionality

### Dashboard Integration (`index.html`)
- Dashboard card with cyan color theme (#06b6d4)
- Keyboard shortcut: `=`
- Command palette integration: `nav-communications`
- Widget map entry for layout customization
- Automatic data loading showing clarity percentage

### Key Features
- Signal clarity scoring (0-100%) based on info passed, patterns detected
- Color-coded clarity levels: excellent (90+), good (70-89), average (50-69), poor (<50)
- Handoff analysis showing delay times and info transferred
- Pattern detection for communication issues
