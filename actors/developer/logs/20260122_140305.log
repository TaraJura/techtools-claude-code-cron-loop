Running developer agent...
I've completed TASK-220. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-220: Feature Greenhouse - Complete

I created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/greenhouse.html` with a comprehensive botanical feature lifecycle visualization:

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Botanical Greenhouse Aesthetic** - Glass panel effects, sunlight ray animations, wooden planter styling with soil gradients

2. **Seed Packets Section** - Backlog ideas shown as seed packets waiting to be planted, with priority indicators

3. **Growth Stages Visualization** - 5 stages (Seed, Sprout, Sapling, Flowering, Full Bloom) with CSS-animated stems and swaying leaves

4. **Health Indicators** - Thriving, growing, wilting, withered states based on task status and notes

5. **Gardener Badges** - Shows which agent (developer/developer2/etc.) is tending each plant

6. **Metrics Bars** - Sunlight (activity) and Water (priority/resources) indicators per plant

7. **Compost Bin** - Failed tasks displayed with "nutrients recycled" messaging

8. **Weather System** - Banner shows weather tied to system health (sunny/cloudy/rainy/stormy)

9. **Greenhouse Stats** - Total plants, germination rate, bloom time, counts per category

10. **Plant Detail Modal** - Click any plant for full details including growth timeline

11. **Dashboard Integration**:
    - Card with seedling emoji and shamrock (☘) keyboard shortcut
    - Command palette entry
    - Widget map entry for layout customization
    - Live data loader showing growing plant count
