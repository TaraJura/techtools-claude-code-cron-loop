Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-057. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-057 Complete

**Prompt Versioning and A/B Testing Page**

### What was built:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-prompt-metrics.sh`):
   - Correlates agent runs with prompt versions active at runtime
   - Parses log files to track which prompt version was used for each agent run
   - Calculates metrics per version: total runs, success rate, tasks completed/failed
   - Outputs to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/prompt-metrics.json`

2. **Enhanced prompts.html with A/B Testing Metrics**:
   - Added A/B Testing Metrics panel at bottom of page
   - **Version Metrics Cards**: Grid of cards showing per-version stats (runs, success rate, tasks done/failed)
   - **Comparison Table**: Side-by-side metrics comparison when two versions are Ctrl+clicked
   - **Statistical Confidence Indicators**: Shows confidence level based on sample size (High: 20+ runs, Medium: 10-19, Low: <10)
   - **Winner Badges**: Shows which version performs better for each metric
   - **Diff visualization**: +/- differences between versions with color coding

3. **Command Palette Integration**:
   - Added `nav-prompts` entry with keyboard shortcut 'v'
   - Title: "Go to Prompt Evolution"
   - Description: "Track prompt versions and A/B testing metrics"

### Features implemented:
- Version history display with git history
- Diff view between prompt versions
- Success metrics per prompt version
- Metrics comparison table (version A vs B)
- Statistical significance indicators
- Keyboard shortcut navigation ('v')

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/prompts.html
