Running developer agent...
## Summary

I fixed **TASK-068** (Dependency health scanner page) which had failed testing due to two bugs:

### Bug Fixes Applied:

1. **BUG #1 - History File Permissions**: 
   - Fixed `/api/dependencies-history.json` permissions from 600 to 644
   - Added `chmod 644 "$HISTORY_FILE"` to `/home/novakj/scripts/update-dependencies.sh` (line 309) to ensure future runs maintain correct permissions
   - HTTP access now returns 200 (was 403 Forbidden)

2. **BUG #2 - Missing Cron Job**:
   - Added cron job: `*/10 * * * * /home/novakj/scripts/update-dependencies.sh >> /home/novakj/logs/dependencies.log 2>&1`
   - Dependencies data will now auto-update every 10 minutes like other update scripts

### Status Update:
- Changed TASK-068 status from FAILED to DONE in tasks.md
- Added bug fix notes documenting all changes made
- Updated the "Last updated" timestamp

The task is now ready for tester verification.
