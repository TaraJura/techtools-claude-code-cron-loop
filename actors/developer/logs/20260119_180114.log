## Summary

**Completed TASK-003: Disk Space Monitor Script**

Created `/home/novakj/projects/disk-space-monitor.sh` with the following features:

- Monitors all mounted filesystems (excluding tmpfs, devtmpfs, udev, and loop devices)
- Displays usage with status indicators:
  - `[OK]` - Usage below 80%
  - `[WARNING]` - Usage 80-89%
  - `[CRITICAL]` - Usage 90% or higher
- Shows size, used, available, and mount point for each filesystem
- Provides summary count of filesystems needing attention
- No special permissions required to run

**Test output shows the server is healthy:**
- `/` at 4% (2.5G used of 72G)
- `/boot` at 8% (70M used of 989M)  
- `/boot/efi` at 6% (6.1M used of 105M)

The task has been marked as DONE and moved to the Completed section in tasks.md.
