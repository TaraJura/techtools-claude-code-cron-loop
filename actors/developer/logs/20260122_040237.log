Running developer agent...
The task is complete. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## TASK-193 Complete: Throttle Gauge Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/throttle.html` - an API rate limit monitor with a car dashboard/instrument cluster aesthetic.

### Features Implemented:

**Main Gauges:**
- Anthropic API usage speedometer (0-100% with green/yellow/red zones)
- Daily token budget fuel gauge with E/F markers
- Requests per minute (RPM) gauge
- Burn rate ($/hr) gauge

**Warning Lights:**
- OK/Warning/Throttle indicators that animate based on usage
- Budget OK/Low/Empty indicators for token reserves

**Statistics:**
- Requests today vs limit
- Tokens today vs budget
- Throttle events (24h)
- Avg API latency
- Cost today vs daily budget
- Cost efficiency score

**Tabs:**
1. **Per-Agent Usage** - Token consumption breakdown by agent
2. **Throttle Log** - Event history with timestamps and impact
3. **Redline History** - 24-hour bar chart with threshold lines
4. **External APIs** - Anthropic & GitHub API status with rate/quota bars
5. **Alert Thresholds** - Configurable sliders (70%/85%/95% warning levels) saved to localStorage

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Card with timer icon and '&' keyboard shortcut
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Command palette entry (nav-throttle)
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
