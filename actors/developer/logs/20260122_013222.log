   - "Meter expired" warnings for overdue ideas
   - Promote to Backlog action
   - Towed section for archived/rejected ideas
   - Parking lot attendant sidebar with weekly stats
   - Search and filter by reason
   - Bulk actions (extend all meters, review expired, bulk tow)
   - Valet service option
   - Export to markdown
