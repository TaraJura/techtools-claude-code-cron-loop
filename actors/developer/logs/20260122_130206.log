I have completed TASK-169. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-169: Code Biopsy Page - Complete

I implemented `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/biopsy.html`, a comprehensive medical pathology-inspired page for deep file health analysis.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Medical Lab Aesthetic** - Clinical white/light theme with specimen cards, microscope imagery, and surgical styling

2. **File Selector** - Category filters (All/Web Pages/Scripts/Docs/Shell/Config) pulling files from changelog.json and heatmap.json

3. **Vital Signs Panel** - Shows estimated lines, total commits, age, days since change, change frequency %, mutation rate

4. **Cell Division Rate** - Weekly/monthly change activity with increasing/stable trend indicators

5. **Mutation History Timeline** - Commits displayed as mutations, color-coded (green=beneficial, red=harmful, yellow=neutral)

6. **Infection Markers** - Bug-related commits from file history

7. **Age Analysis** - Creation date, last modification, staleness classification (Fresh/Recent/Maturing/Ancient)

8. **DNA Fingerprint** - Visual representation with stable/variable/hotspot/recent patterns

9. **Neighboring Tissue** - Files frequently changed together with co-change counts

10. **Prognosis & Recommendations** - AI-generated health assessment with actionable recommendations

11. **Health Score Ring** - 0-100 score with color-coded badge (Healthy/Fair/Concerning/Critical)

12. **Export Report** - Downloadable text biopsy report

13. **Compare Specimens Mode** - UI for side-by-side file comparison

14. **Specimen Archive** - Recent examinations stored in localStorage
