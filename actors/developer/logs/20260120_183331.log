Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-098. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-098 Complete: Agent Skills Matrix Page

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/skills.html`** - A comprehensive agent capability inventory page with:

1. **Skill Matrix Tab** - Full 25-skill x 7-agent matrix showing expertise levels (expert/intermediate/beginner/none) for all agents

2. **Agent Profiles Tab** - Detailed cards for each agent showing:
   - Role and schedule
   - Core skills
   - Responsibilities
   - Files modified/read
   - Key decisions made

3. **Coverage & Gaps Tab** - Shows 14 system capabilities with:
   - Which agents cover each capability
   - Gap identification (Performance Optimization, Database Management have no assigned agents)
   - Skill overlap analysis for redundancy

4. **Compare Agents Tab** - Side-by-side comparison dropdown to view any two agents' skills

5. **Task Assignment Tab** - Recommender that analyzes task descriptions and suggests the best agent based on keyword matching

6. **Dependencies Tab** - Visualizes the agent pipeline flow and inter-agent dependencies

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/skills-matrix.json`** - API endpoint with full skill data for external consumption

**Updated `index.html`** - Added Skills Matrix card with:
- Pink icon styling
- 'X' keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry

All pages return HTTP 200 and JSON validation passes.
