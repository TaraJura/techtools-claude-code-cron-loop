I've completed **TASK-032: Add security audit dashboard page to CronLoop web app**.

## Summary of Implementation

**Created Files:**

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/security-metrics.sh`** - Shell script that consolidates security data from existing tools into JSON:
   - Extracts SSH brute force data from auth.log (total attempts, unique IPs, top 5 attackers)
   - Scans open ports using `ss` command
   - Checks file permissions (world-writable, 777/666 files)
   - Gets package update counts (total, security, reboot status)
   - Verifies nginx security rules (.git, .env, .log blocking)
   - Calculates overall security score (0-100)
   - Generates recommendations based on issues found

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/security.html`** - Security dashboard page with:
   - Security Score hero section (score + Secure/Warning/Critical status)
   - SSH Brute Force card (10,918 attempts detected, 81 unique IPs, top 5 attackers listed)
   - Open Ports card (4 ports: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS)
   - Package Updates card (66 total, 39 security updates)
   - File Permissions card (0 issues found)
   - Nginx Security card (verifies blocking rules)
   - Recommendations section with severity-coded actionable items
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

3. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** - Added Security card to main dashboard showing score and link

4. **Added cron job** - Updates security metrics every 5 minutes

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/security.html

The dashboard shows a current security score of **40 (Critical)** due to:
- 10,918 SSH brute force attempts (ongoing attack)
- 39 security package updates available
