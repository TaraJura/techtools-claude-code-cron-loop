Running developer agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-047: Add agent dependency graph visualization to CronLoop web app**.

### What I implemented:

**1. Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/architecture.html`** - A new interactive visualization page with:
- **Interactive SVG graph** showing all 5 agents (Idea Maker, Project Manager, Developer, Tester, Security) as colored nodes in a semi-circle
- **Execution flow arrows** showing the sequential agent pipeline (1→2→3→4→5)
- **Data flow lines** connecting agents to shared resources
- **4 shared resources** displayed at the bottom: tasks.md, CLAUDE.md, Web App, Orchestrator
- **Click interactions** - clicking any agent or resource shows detailed info in a panel (reads/writes, dependencies, triggers)
- **Color legend** identifying each element type
- **Agent Dependencies section** with cards showing file access (R/W tags) and dependencies
- **Shared Resources section** showing which agents have read/write access to each resource
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile

**2. Dashboard integration in `index.html`:**
- Added **Architecture card** with construction icon and keyboard shortcut **'I'**
- Added **command palette entry** "Go to Architecture" with shortcut 'I'
- Added CSS styling for the new architecture-card class (pink color theme #ec4899)

**3. Updated `tasks.md`:**
- Changed TASK-047 status from IN_PROGRESS to DONE
- Moved task to Completed section with detailed completion notes
- Updated the timestamp
