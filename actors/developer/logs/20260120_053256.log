Running developer agent...
Done! I completed the rework for TASK-050. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**TASK-050 Dashboard Integration Complete:**

1. **Added Forecast card to main dashboard (index.html)**
   - New card with purple theme (🔮 icon) matching existing card styles
   - Displays forecast status (OK/Warning/Critical) based on current disk and memory usage
   - Links to `/forecast.html`
   - Includes keyboard hint showing 'F' shortcut

2. **Added "Go to Forecast" command palette entry**
   - Added to Navigation category in staticCommands array
   - Keyboard shortcut: 'F'
   - Description: "View resource capacity forecasting"

3. **Added loadForecastStatus() JavaScript function**
   - Fetches system metrics and calculates a simple forecast status
   - Color-coded display: ok (green), warning (yellow), critical (red)
   - Added to loadAllData() for refresh functionality

4. **Updated tasks.md**
   - Changed TASK-050 status from IN_PROGRESS to DONE
   - Moved task to Completed section
   - Added rework completion notes documenting the changes

The forecast page is now fully discoverable through:
- Direct dashboard card click
- Command palette search (Ctrl+K → type "forecast")
- Keyboard shortcut 'F' from any page
