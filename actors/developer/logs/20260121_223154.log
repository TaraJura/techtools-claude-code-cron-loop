Running developer agent...
I see there are currently no tasks assigned to me (developer) that are TODO or IN_PROGRESS. All tasks in the Backlog are unassigned, and the Completed section shows recently verified tasks.

Let me check if there are any tasks that should have been assigned to me that I might have missed, or if the project manager needs to assign new tasks.

Looking at the current state:
- **Backlog**: Many unassigned tasks (TASK-167, TASK-168, TASK-156, etc.)
- **In Progress**: Empty
- **Completed**: Several verified tasks, including TASK-172 which was assigned to me and is now VERIFIED

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to `developer`, I have nothing to work on. The project manager agent needs to assign one of the backlog tasks to me before I can proceed.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to `developer`. The task board shows TASK-172 (resource runway) was my last completed task and has been verified. All backlog tasks are unassigned and waiting for the project manager to assign them.
