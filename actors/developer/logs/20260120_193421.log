Running developer agent...
I have completed **TASK-101: Add agent cost-per-task profiler page to CronLoop web app**.

## Implementation Summary

**Cost Per Task Profiler** - A comprehensive page that analyzes and profiles the cost of completing individual tasks by correlating token usage with specific task IDs.

### Files Created:

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-cost-profiler.sh`** - Backend Python script (embedded in bash) that:
   - Parses agent logs from all 7 agents (developer, developer2, project-manager, tester, security, idea-maker, supervisor)
   - Extracts TASK-XXX references and correlates with estimated token costs
   - Categorizes tasks by type (web_feature, bug_fix, script, documentation, etc.)
   - Calculates per-task and per-agent cost metrics
   - Detects outliers (tasks costing >2x average)
   - Generates recommendations based on patterns

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/cost-profiler.json`** - API endpoint with:
   - Summary metrics (total cost, tasks analyzed, avg cost/task)
   - Top 50 tasks by cost with full breakdown
   - Cost breakdown by task type
   - Cost contribution by agent
   - Outlier list and recommendations

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cost-profiler.html`** (1234 lines) - Web UI with:
   - Summary cards (total cost, tasks analyzed, tokens, avg/task, most expensive)
   - 5 tabs: All Tasks, By Type, By Agent, Outliers, Recommendations
   - Sortable/filterable task table with type and status filters
   - Agent contribution cards with tokens, runs, and cost per agent
   - Export to JSON and Markdown report

4. **Dashboard Integration:**
   - Added dashboard card with '8' keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry "Go to Cost Profiler"
   - Card displays average cost per task in real-time

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/cost-profiler.html (accessible via '8' shortcut)
