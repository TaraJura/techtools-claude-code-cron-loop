Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-114. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-114: External Integrations Status Page - Completed

### Created Files:
1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/integrations.html`** - The main integrations page featuring:
   - Overall health score (0-100%) with visual progress ring
   - Integration cards for each external service showing status, latency, and details
   - Status badges (Connected, Degraded, Error, Not Configured, etc.)
   - Test connection buttons for manual verification
   - Dependency map showing which dashboard features rely on each integration
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-integrations.sh`** - Backend script that monitors:
   - GitHub API (gh CLI installation and authentication status)
   - Claude API (inferred from recent agent activity)
   - Webhooks (configuration and delivery status)
   - Nginx web server (service status and latency)
   - Cron scheduler (service status and job count)
   - SSL certificate (expiry date and days remaining)

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/integrations.json`** - API data file with integration status

### Updated Files:
- **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** - Added:
  - Dashboard card showing "X/Y OK" health summary
  - Keyboard shortcut `&` for quick navigation
  - Command palette entry for "Go to Integrations"
  - Widget mapping for layout customization
  - `loadIntegrationsStatus()` function to update card dynamically

- **`/home/novakj/scripts/action-processor.sh`** - Added `update_integrations` action
