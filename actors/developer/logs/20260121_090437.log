Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-147. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-147 Completed: GitHub-style Activity Calendar Heatmap

### Created Files:
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/activity-calendar.html` - Main page with full GitHub-style heatmap

### Features Implemented:
1. **GitHub-style Contribution Calendar** - Traditional weeks-as-columns, days-as-rows heatmap with 5-level green intensity
2. **Multiple View Modes** - 7 days (with hourly detail), 30 days, 90 days
3. **Activity Filtering** - All activity, commits only, agent runs only, tasks only
4. **Statistics Hero** - Total activities, busiest day, daily average, streak counter with fire badge
5. **Hourly Heatmap** - Detailed hour-by-day grid for 7-day view
6. **Activity Breakdowns** - Bar charts showing activity by type and by agent
7. **Patterns & Insights** - Peak activity hour, most active day, quietest period, anomaly count
8. **Anomaly Detection** - Visual markers (gold outline) for unusual activity levels
9. **Interactive Tooltips** - Hover on any cell to see date, count, and breakdown
10. **Export** - JSON export button
11. **Auto-refresh** - Updates every 5 minutes

### Dashboard Integration:
- Dashboard card with `§` keyboard shortcut (note: 'A' was already taken by Agents page)
- Widget map entry for layout customization
- Command palette entry `nav-activity-calendar`
- Card shows today's activity count dynamically

### Data Sources:
- `/api/changelog.json` - Git commit activity
- `/api/timeline.json` - Agent execution activity
