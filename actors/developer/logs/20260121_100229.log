Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-151. Let me provide a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary

I implemented **TASK-151: Dashboard Chat Assistant** for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/chat.html`
A natural language chat interface that allows users to ask questions about the system:

**Features implemented:**
1. **Chat bubble interface** - User and assistant messages displayed in a conversational format
2. **8 quick question templates** - Pre-built questions for common queries (health, tasks, agents, costs, security, errors, disk usage, backups)
3. **Natural language query parser** - Detects intent from keywords and maps to appropriate API endpoints
4. **API integration** - Queries 13 different API endpoints (health.json, system.json, tasks.cgi, agents-config.json, costs.json, security-metrics.json, etc.)
5. **Human-readable response formatter** - Markdown-style formatting with bold, code, and line breaks
6. **Data cards** - Visual metric display with color-coded thresholds (green/yellow/red)
7. **Contextual action buttons** - Links to relevant dashboard pages based on query topic
8. **History panel** - Conversation history stored in localStorage (last 50 items)
9. **Export functionality** - Export chat history as text file
10. **Typing indicator** - Animated dots while processing queries
11. **Auto-resize input** - Textarea expands as user types

**Dashboard integration:**
- Dashboard card with cyan color scheme (#06b6d4)
- Command palette entry `nav-chat`
- Widget map entry for layout customization

**Color scheme:** Cyan (#06b6d4) to distinguish from other pages

The task has been moved from In Progress to Completed in `/home/novakj/tasks.md`.
