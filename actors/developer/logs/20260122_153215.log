## Summary

I've successfully implemented **TASK-224: Nerve Center** - a real-time system vital signs biometric display page for the CronLoop web app.

### What was created:

**`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/nerve-center.html`** - A full ICU-style monitoring page featuring:

1. **CPU as Heart Rate (EKG)**: Animated EKG-style waveform with BPM calculated from CPU load, shows Tachycardia warning when >120 BPM

2. **Memory as Blood Pressure**: Systolic (used) / Diastolic (cached) display in mmHg format with a visual gauge, hypertension warnings

3. **Disk I/O as Respiratory Rate**: Animated breathing waveform showing read/write cycles, hyperventilation and apnea warnings

4. **Network as Neural Activity**: Animated bar visualization of packet traffic, spike and seizure detection for anomalies

5. **Temperature as Body Temperature**: Thermometer visualization with fever zones (Normal/Fever/Critical), Fahrenheit conversion

6. **Patient Status Banner**: Stable/Guarded/Critical/Code Blue based on composite health score

7. **Code Blue Alarm**: Dramatic red overlay with shake animation when multiple vitals critical

8. **Vital History Charts**: Last 60 minutes of data for each vital sign

9. **Nurse's Notes**: Event log styled as medical chart entries

10. **Medication Panel**: Running services displayed as administered medications

11. **Visiting Hours**: Deploy safety indicator (Good/Caution/Bad)

12. **Sound Toggle**: Optional heartbeat beep using Web Audio API

13. **Dashboard Integration**: Card with heart icon, caduceus (⚕) keyboard shortcut, command palette entry, and widgetMap entry
