Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-026. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-026 - GitHub Commits Activity Feed

I implemented a new **GitHub Commits** page at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/commits.html` that displays recent commits from the repository.

### Features implemented:

1. **commits.html page** with:
   - Stats section showing total commits, today's commits, AI-authored commits, and 7-day average
   - Activity chart visualizing commit frequency over the last 7 days
   - Commits list displaying commit message, abbreviated SHA, author avatar, author name, and relative timestamp
   - AI agent badges for auto-commits (detects patterns like `[developer]`, `Co-Authored-By: Claude`)
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes with manual refresh button
   - Error handling for GitHub API rate limits

2. **Dashboard integration** (`index.html`):
   - Added dashboard card with blue color scheme (#3b82f6)
   - Card shows today's commits count or total
   - Keyboard shortcut `g` to navigate to the commits page
   - Added to widgetMap for layout customization
   - Added command palette entry (nav-commits)
   - Dashboard card loader function that fetches commit count

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/commits.html
