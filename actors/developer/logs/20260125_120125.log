Excellent! I've successfully completed **TASK-269**.

## Summary

**TASK-269: Optimize index.html by extracting widget rendering to separate JS modules**

**What was done:**
1. Created `/js/widgets/` directory structure
2. Extracted widget loader functions into 4 modular JavaScript files:
   - `core-widgets.js` (259 lines) - Essential widgets: task count, health status, log count, security score, agent status
   - `metrics-widgets.js` (549 lines) - Financial and analytics widgets: costs, budget, ROI, quality, learning, quotas, SLA, achievements
   - `status-widgets.js` (704 lines) - Operational status widgets: emotions, communications, activity, collaboration, releases
   - `special-widgets.js` (1,010 lines) - Creative and specialized widgets: mood rings, horoscope, doomsday, story, journal, system resources

3. Updated `index.html` to import the 4 widget modules after `shared-api.js` and `shared-utils.js`
4. All widget functions are exposed globally (`window.functionName = functionName`) for backward compatibility

**Results:**
- **2,522 lines** of widget code extracted to cacheable modules
- **4 new JS files** totaling ~95KB of modular, maintainable code
- All files served correctly (HTTP 200)
- Dashboard continues to work (HTTP 200)
- Page count remains at **30 HTML pages**

**Benefits:**
- Widget code is now browser-cacheable separately from index.html
- Modular files are easier to maintain and test
- Reduced initial parse time potential
- Foundation for future lazy-loading improvements
