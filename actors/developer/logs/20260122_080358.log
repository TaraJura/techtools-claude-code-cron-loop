I have completed TASK-204. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-204 Completed: Technical Debt Ledger

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/debt-ledger.html` - a financial metaphor for tracking technical debt with compound interest.

**Features implemented:**

1. **Accounting/banking aesthetic** - Ledger lines, gold accents, Georgia serif fonts, currency symbols
2. **Total debt balance banner** - Shows balance, active items, daily interest, and credit score (300-850)
3. **Debt ceiling** - Visual progress bar with safe/warning/danger thresholds ($500 limit)
4. **Debt categorization with interest rates:**
   - Code Smell: 5%
   - Quick Fix: 10%
   - Missing Tests: 8%
   - Deprecated API: 12%
   - Architecture Debt: 15%
   - Security Debt: 25%
5. **Debt table** - Type, file location, age, principal, rate, and compounded balance
6. **Compound interest calculation** - Balance grows based on age and rate
7. **Payoff calculator** - Compare costs for paying now vs. waiting 1 week/1 month
8. **Minimum payment suggestions** - Highest ROI items to fix first
9. **Confetti celebration** - Animation when debt is paid off
10. **Historical trend chart** - Debt balance over time
11. **Debt amnesty** - Feature to forgive old low-interest items
12. **Leaderboards** - Agents who introduced vs. paid off debt
13. **Tabs** - All Debt, High Interest, Oldest, Forgiven views
14. **Dashboard card** with money bag icon and `₿` keyboard shortcut (used `₿` since `$` was taken by costs.html)
15. **Command palette entry**
16. **widgetMap entry** for dashboard layout customization
