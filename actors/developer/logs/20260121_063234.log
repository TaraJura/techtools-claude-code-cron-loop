Running developer agent...
Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary: TASK-119 Completed

I've implemented the **Agent Frustration and Emotional Intelligence Monitor** page with the following components:

### Backend Script
- **Location**: `/home/novakj/scripts/update-emotions.sh`
- Analyzes agent logs for emotional/behavioral indicators:
  - Frustration patterns: "let me try again", "that didn't work", "failed to", "retry", etc.
  - Confidence positive markers: "successfully", "completed", "verified", etc.
  - Uncertainty markers: "I think", "probably", "might", "should work", etc.
- Calculates per-agent metrics: wellness score (0-100), frustration level, confidence score
- Determines dominant mood: confident, calm, uncertain, struggling, frustrated
- Generates recommendations when agents show concerning patterns
- Outputs to `/api/emotions.json`

### Frontend Page
- **Location**: `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/emotions.html`
- **Features**:
  1. Hero section with system emoji and overall wellness score (0-100%)
  2. Stats grid showing: healthy agents count, avg confidence, avg frustration, runs analyzed
  3. Mood legend explaining emoji meanings (confident, calm, uncertain, struggling, frustrated)
  4. Three tabs: Agent Status, Mood Timeline, Recommendations
  5. Per-agent cards with wellness bars, metrics (wellness, frustration, confidence), recent moods
  6. Canvas-based timeline chart showing confidence vs frustration over last 24 hours
  7. Export to JSON functionality
  8. Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard card with `:` keyboard shortcut showing system emoji and wellness percentage
- Command palette entry (nav-emotions) for quick navigation
- Widget map entry for layout customization
- CSS styles with purple/pink color scheme (#a855f7)

### API Endpoint
- `/api/emotions.json` provides comprehensive emotional health metrics
- Current status: **99% wellness** - all agents operating in "confident" mood
