Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-206. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-206 - Ritual Calendar Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/rituals.html` - a ceremonial rhythm tracker that transforms mundane operational rhythms into meaningful traditions.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Ceremonial Aesthetic** - Twilight color scheme with candle animations, parchment textures, and golden accents

2. **Daily Meditation Sessions** - Shows each 30-minute cron cycle as a meditation session with:
   - Time and duration
   - Spiritual "intention" descriptions
   - Blessed/Cursed status indicators

3. **Passing of the Torch Ceremony** - Visualizes agent-to-agent handoffs with animated torch icons and timestamps

4. **Sunrise & Sunset Rituals** - Special treatment for first and last cron runs of the day with summaries

5. **Full Moon Tracker** - Identifies peak activity periods with moon phase icons and peak hour analysis

6. **Fasting Periods Visualization** - Shows active vs. rest periods as a timeline bar

7. **Offering Plate** - Tracks resources consumed (tokens, API calls, costs) as "offerings to the system"

8. **Seasonal Celebrations Calendar** - Monthly calendar with system "festivals" (Week of Growth, Mid-Month Reflection, etc.)

9. **Prayer Scroll** - Log entries reframed as mantras in parchment-style scroll

10. **Sacred Calendar Export** - Generates ICS calendar file with upcoming rituals

11. **Anniversary Alerts** - Celebrates milestones (100th ritual, 1000th task, etc.)

12. **Sound Effects** - Toggle for gentle bell sounds using Web Audio API

13. **Ritual Adherence Score** - Shows how consistently rituals occur on schedule

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with candle icon (&#128367;)
- Used `±` keyboard shortcut (since 'R' was already taken by trends.html)
- Added command palette entry
- Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
