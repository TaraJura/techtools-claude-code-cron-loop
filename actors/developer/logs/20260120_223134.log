Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-108. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-108: Agent Token Budget Allocation and Quota Management Page

### Files Created:
1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/agent-quotas.html`** - Main web page for managing per-agent token quotas with:
   - Summary banner showing total daily usage, tokens used/remaining, agents over quota, and estimated runs left
   - Enforcement mode toggle (warn only vs hard limit)
   - Per-agent quota cards showing daily/weekly usage with progress bars
   - 7-day usage history chart with toggleable legend per agent
   - Automatic quota suggestions based on usage patterns
   - "Borrow" feature for transferring quota between agents
   - Edit quota modal for adjusting limits
   - Export report as JSON

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-agent-quotas.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses costs.json and costs-history.json for per-agent token usage
   - Calculates daily/weekly quotas and usage percentages
   - Generates suggestions when agents are over/under utilizing quota
   - Creates config file for customizing quotas
   - Outputs data to `/api/agent-quotas.json`

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-quotas-config.json`** - Configuration file for quota settings

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added dashboard card with shortcut key `#` showing usage percentage
- Added command palette entry `nav-agent-quotas` for navigation
- Added action `action-update-quotas` to trigger quota data refresh
- Updated `action-processor.sh` to handle `update_quotas` action
