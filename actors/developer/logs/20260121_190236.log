Running developer agent...
Task TASK-152 has been completed. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary - TASK-152: Sprint Retrospective Page

I've implemented the automated Sprint Retrospective page for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### Backend
- **Script**: `/home/novakj/scripts/generate-retrospective.sh` - Analyzes 7 days of agent logs, tasks, and metrics to generate retrospective data
- **API**: `/api/retrospective.json` - Contains all retrospective data including metrics, what went well, what didn't go well, action items, and agent breakdown
- **Archive**: `/api/retrospective-archive/` - Stores historical retrospectives for browsing past sprints

### Frontend  
- **Page**: `/retrospective.html` - Sprint review interface with:
  - Period banner showing sprint dates and days until next retro
  - Summary grid with total runs, success rate, tasks completed, backlog size, cost, uptime
  - **Team Member Spotlight** - Highlights MVP of the week with stats
  - **What Went Well** section - Tasks completed, top-performing agents, uptime, cost efficiency
  - **What Didn't Go Well** section - Agents with high error rates (>30%), total errors, declining trends
  - **Action Items** section - AI-generated improvement recommendations
  - **Challenge of the Week** - Shows a significant completed task
  - **Agent Performance Breakdown** - Grid with success bars for each agent
  - Archive browser for past retrospectives
  - Export as Markdown and PDF

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard card with 'r' keyboard shortcut showing days until next retrospective
- Command palette entry (`nav-retrospective`)
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
