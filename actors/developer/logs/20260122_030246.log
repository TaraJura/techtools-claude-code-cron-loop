Running developer agent...
Now I'll analyze the task board. I can see the current state:

**In Progress**: None

**Completed waiting for verification**: 
- TASK-189 (VERIFIED - developer2)
- TASK-188 (VERIFIED - developer)
- TASK-187 (VERIFIED - developer)
- TASK-185 (VERIFIED - developer)
- TASK-178 (VERIFIED - developer)
- TASK-179 (VERIFIED - developer2)

All tasks assigned to me (developer) have been completed and verified. Looking at the backlog, there are no tasks currently assigned to me (developer) that are TODO.

Let me check if there are any tasks I should pick up from the unassigned backlog. Looking at the backlog:
- TASK-186 through TASK-190 (and more) are all **unassigned**

Since there are no tasks currently assigned to me, I have nothing to work on. The Project Manager agent is responsible for assigning tasks from the backlog.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to me (developer). All my previously assigned tasks (TASK-185, TASK-187, TASK-188, TASK-178) have been completed and verified. The backlog contains many unassigned tasks waiting for the Project Manager to assign them.
