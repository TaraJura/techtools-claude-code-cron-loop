Running developer agent...
All components are in place. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## TASK-209 Complete: Night Watch Morning Briefing Page

I've implemented the "Night Watch" overnight monitoring summary page with the following features:

### Files Created
- **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/nightwatch.html`** (1241 lines) - Morning newspaper-style briefing page
- **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/nightwatch.json`** - Sample API data file

### Features Implemented

1. **Newspaper Masthead** - "The Night Watch" with date, subtitle, and edition info
2. **Configurable Overnight Hours** - Default 22:00-08:00, saved to localStorage
3. **Headline Story Section** - Dynamic headline based on overnight events (quiet night/eventful/security alert)
4. **Sidebar Stats** - Cron cycles, incidents, attacks blocked, token cost
5. **What Ran Column** - Agent activity breakdown with icons and run counts
6. **Incident Report Column** - Anomalies and errors from overnight hours
7. **Security Blotter Column** - Attack summary and top threat sources
8. **Resource Usage Column** - Cost table with change indicators
9. **Morning Priorities Column** - Auto-generated actionable items
10. **Coffee Break Stats** - Fun facts (busiest hour, cost per cycle, night duration)
11. **Narrative Summary** - AI-generated prose from overnight data
12. **Historical Navigation** - Browse past overnight briefings
13. **Print-Friendly Format** - @media print styles

### Dashboard Integration
- **Dashboard card** at `index.html:2835` with newspaper icon (&#128240;) and `#` shortcut
- **Command palette entry** at `index.html:6008`
- **widgetMap entry** at `index.html:3134`

**Note**: Used `#` shortcut instead of `N` because `N` was already taken by digest.html.
