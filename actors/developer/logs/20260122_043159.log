## Summary

I implemented **TASK-195: Second Opinion** - an automated peer review page for agent-generated code changes.

**What was created:**

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/second-opinion.html`** - A comprehensive peer review page featuring:
   - Hero score section with animated SVG ring showing overall second opinion score (0-100)
   - Three approval stamps: "Looks Good" (green), "Minor Concerns" (yellow), "Needs Attention" (red)
   - Summary stats grid showing commits reviewed, review comments, quick fixes, patterns detected, similar code found, and average score
   - Filter panel for severity, agent, analysis lens, and date range
   - Four tabs:
     - **Commit Reviews**: Two-column layout with commit list and detailed review panel showing 7 analysis lenses (Patterns, Errors, Edge Cases, Security, Performance, Docs, Tests), inline comments, patterns detected, similar code finder, and quick fix suggestions
     - **Per-Agent Analysis**: Table showing each agent's commits, avg score, common issues, with mini-bar charts
     - **Patterns Detected**: Shows patterns followed vs violated across the codebase
     - **Historical Accuracy**: Calibration metrics tracking prediction accuracy over time
   - Export as Markdown/JSON functionality
   - Request re-review button
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **Dashboard Integration** (index.html):
   - Dashboard card with glasses emoji (👓), purple accent (#a855f7), 'O' keyboard shortcut
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Command palette entry (nav-second-opinion)

3. **tasks.md**: Updated task status to DONE and moved to Completed section
