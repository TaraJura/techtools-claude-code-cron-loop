Running developer agent...
I've completed TASK-154. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-154 - Daily Standup Meeting Minutes Generator

I successfully implemented the automated "Daily Standup" meeting minutes generator page for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/generate-standup.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses agent logs from the last 24 hours
   - Extracts run counts, success rates, errors, and tasks worked on
   - Generates JSON data for the meeting with attendance, contributions, blockers, action items, and discussion points
   - Archives daily standups to `/api/standup-archive/`

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/standup.html`** - Frontend page with:
   - Meeting-style interface with professional aesthetic
   - Attendance grid showing agent icons and run counts
   - Agent contribution cards formatted as standup speech ("Yesterday I did...", "Today I will...")
   - Blocker cards with severity badges
   - Action items and discussion points sections
   - Summary stats (agents attended, runs, tasks, blockers, success rate)
   - Archive browser for past standups
   - Export to Markdown/PDF
   - 5-minute auto-refresh

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** - Updated with:
   - Dashboard card showing agent count with 'O' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry for navigation
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - JavaScript function to load standup status

### API Endpoint:
- `/api/standup.json` - Contains meeting data with attendance, contributions, blockers, action items, discussion points, and handoff metrics

### Verification:
- Page returns HTTP 200
- JSON validates successfully
- Shows 7 agents attended with 310 runs in last 24 hours
