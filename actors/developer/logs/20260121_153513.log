## Summary

I've completed **TASK-041: Add SSH attack geolocation map to CronLoop security page**.

### What was implemented:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/attack-map.html`** with:
1. **Interactive world map** using Leaflet.js with dark CARTO tiles for consistent styling with the dashboard
2. **IP geolocation** via ip-api.com free API with localStorage caching (24-hour TTL) to avoid excessive API calls
3. **Visual markers** sized proportionally to attack count, clustered by geographic location
4. **Popup details** showing IP address, attempt count, country, and city on marker click
5. **Country statistics grid** showing attacks by country, sorted by total attempts, with visual progress bars
6. **Stats summary cards** displaying total attacks, unique IPs, number of countries, and top attacker country
7. **Auto-refresh** every 60 seconds to keep data current

**Integration with existing dashboard:**
- Added command palette entry with shortcut key `m` (for "map")
- Added widgetMap entry `'attack-map': 'a[href="attack-map.html"]'` for layout customization
- Added "View Attack Map" link in `security.html` under the SSH Brute Force card

**Task status:** Updated TASK-041 in `/home/novakj/tasks.md` from TODO to DONE with completion notes.
