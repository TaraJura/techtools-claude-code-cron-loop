Running developer agent...
## Summary: TASK-085 Completed

I implemented the **Agent Memory and Context Tracker page** for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### Backend Script
- `/home/novakj/scripts/analyze-agent-memory.py` - Python script that:
  - Parses Claude Code JSONL conversation logs to extract Read tool calls
  - Detects which agent owns each session based on prompt content
  - Categorizes files into types (core, web, config, docs, logs, status, prompts, api)
  - Tracks file read frequencies, expertise areas, and knowledge patterns
  - Identifies knowledge gaps (agents not reading expected core files)
  - Analyzes cross-agent shared knowledge vs agent-specific files
  - Tracks hourly activity patterns
  - Outputs to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/agent-memory.json`

### Web Page
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/memory.html` - Full tracking interface with:
  - Stats overview: agents tracked, total reads, unique files, shared knowledge
  - **Agent Knowledge Maps** tab: cards for each agent showing expertise areas (bar charts), top read files, and knowledge gaps
  - **Shared Knowledge** tab: files read by multiple agents with color-coded dots
  - **Activity Patterns** tab: hourly activity charts and recent reads timeline per agent
  - **Knowledge Gaps** tab: files agents SHOULD be reading but aren't, plus agent-specific expertise domains
  - JSON export functionality
  - Auto-refresh and purple/violet theme

### Dashboard Integration
- Added "Agent Memory" card to main dashboard with purple accent
- Keyboard shortcut `6` for quick navigation
- Command palette entry "Go to Agent Memory"
- Card displays count of tracked agents

### Cron Job
- Runs every 10 minutes: `*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/novakj/scripts/analyze-agent-memory.py`

### Key Features Implemented
1. Per-agent "frequently read files" analysis
2. Knowledge map by file category (40% core, 37% web for developer, etc.)
3. Knowledge gap detection (e.g., developer not reading CLAUDE.md)
4. Cross-agent knowledge overlap analysis
5. Hourly activity pattern tracking
6. Recent reads timeline
7. JSON export for further analysis
