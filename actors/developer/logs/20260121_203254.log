I have completed TASK-051: Add cross-event correlation dashboard to CronLoop web app.

## Summary of Implementation

I enhanced the existing `correlation.html` page from a simple metrics correlation matrix into a comprehensive **Cross-Event Correlation Dashboard**. The new implementation includes:

**Key Features:**

1. **Unified Event Timeline** - Multi-track visualization showing Agent Runs, Agent Errors, Memory Spikes, CPU Spikes, Disk Writes, Task Completions, Task Failures, and Security Events on a shared timeline with color-coded event markers

2. **Event Density Heatmap** - 7-day × 24-hour grid showing when events cluster, with filtering by event type to reveal patterns like "errors peak at 3 AM on weekdays"

3. **Correlation Matrix** - Pearson correlation coefficients calculated between all event type pairs, displayed in a color-coded matrix (green for positive, red for negative correlations)

4. **Temporal Correlation Detection** - Identifies event pairs that frequently occur within 5 minutes of each other

5. **Anomaly Detection** - Two sections: Pattern-Breaking Events (activity at unusual hours 2-5 AM) and Suspicious Coincidences (different event types within 1 minute)

6. **AI Summary Tab** - Natural language summary with highlighted statistics, key findings cards, strongest correlations, error activity counts, and peak hour identification

7. **Export Functionality** - JSON, CSV, and plain text report formats

8. **Time Window Selector** - 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days

9. **Auto-refresh** every 5 minutes

**Data Sources:** The page pulls from activity.json, metrics-history.json, error-patterns.json, analytics.json, and timeline.json.

**Dashboard Updates:** Updated the card title to "Event Correlation" with label "Cross-Event Patterns", and updated the status loader to show total event count.
