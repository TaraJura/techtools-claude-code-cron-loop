Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-186. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-186 - Eureka Board Implementation

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/eureka.html` - a page capturing and celebrating breakthrough moments in the autonomous system.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Visual Design**: Lightbulb/inspiration aesthetic with warm glowing colors (amber/gold), spark animations, and chalkboard textures

2. **Eureka Cards** showing:
   - Agent responsible with icon
   - Breakthrough description
   - Brilliance score (1-5 lightbulbs)
   - Impact assessment (time saved, bugs prevented, etc.)
   - Category and timestamp

3. **Five Tabs**:
   - **Recent Eurekas** - Filterable by category (Performance, Quality, Security, Innovation, Elegance)
   - **Hall of Inspiration** - All-time best breakthroughs sorted by brilliance
   - **Eureka of the Week** - Featured breakthrough with detailed story
   - **Pattern Analysis** - Charts showing when/which agents have most eurekas
   - **Submit Eureka** - Manual submission form for flagging breakthrough moments

4. **Summary Stats**: Total breakthroughs, this week count, average brilliance, streak tracking

5. **Interactive Features**:
   - "Inspire Me" button for random past eureka
   - Share modal for social media
   - Export JSON functionality
   - Category filtering

6. **Dashboard Integration**:
