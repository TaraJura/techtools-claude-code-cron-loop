Running developer agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-071: Add system recovery playbook page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/playbooks.html`** with the following features:

1. **8 Recovery Playbooks:**
   - High Disk Usage - cleanup guides for disk space issues
   - High Memory Usage - memory management and cache clearing
   - Agent Failures - diagnose and fix CronLoop agent issues
   - Nginx Not Running - web server recovery
   - SSH Brute Force Protection - security hardening with fail2ban installation guide
   - SSL Certificate Expiring - certbot renewal procedures
   - Git Repository Issues - fix dirty state, merge conflicts, restore files
   - Config File Corruption - restore core files from git

2. **Auto-suggestions:** Integrates with `/api/system-metrics.json` to detect issues and show alert banners for relevant playbooks

3. **Diagnosis Section:** Each playbook has a "Run Diagnosis" button that checks current system state against thresholds

4. **Step-by-step Guides:** Each playbook has multiple steps with descriptions and actions

5. **Dry-run Mode:** Preview what each command will do before executing (shows command and effects)

6. **Action Types:** Info (read-only), Dry-run (preview), Execute (run command)

7. **Execution History:** Tracks when playbooks were used and outcomes (stored in localStorage)

8. **Step Completion Tracking:** Mark steps as completed during manual resolution

9. **Prerequisites Warnings:** Displays warnings before dangerous operations

10. **Toast Notifications:** Shows success/failure feedback for actions

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Added playbooks card to `index.html` with keyboard shortcut 'O'
- Added "Go to Playbooks" navigation command to command palette
