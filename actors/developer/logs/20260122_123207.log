Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-140. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-140 Implementation Summary

Created **pulse-network.html** - a real-time heartbeat mesh visualization page for the CronLoop web app.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Canvas-based animated mesh visualization** with nodes representing system components
2. **Node types with distinct visual styles**:
   - Hexagons for agents
   - Circles for API endpoints
   - Documents for log files
   - Gears for config files
   - Clouds for external services
   - Clocks for cron jobs

3. **Real-time data flow visualization**:
   - Pulsing nodes (healthy pulse normally, warnings pulse faster, errors flatline)
   - Traveling particles on active connections
   - Dashed lines for idle connections

4. **Health indicators**:
   - Green = healthy
   - Yellow = warning
   - Red = error
   - Grey = inactive

5. **Three zoom levels**: Satellite (0.6x), Neighborhood (1x), Street view (1.5x with labels)

6. **Interactive features**:
   - Click nodes to see details (last pulse, pulse rate, connections, status)
   - Flatline detection with alerts for nodes inactive >45 minutes
   - Constellation mode to rearrange by logical grouping
   - Historical playback slider (24 hours)

7. **Vital signs sidebar**:
   - System BPM
   - Active nodes count
   - Health score percentage
   - Pulse sync percentage

8. **Dashboard integration**:
   - Card added to index.html with '⊙' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry
   - WidgetMap entry for layout customization

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/pulse-network.html
