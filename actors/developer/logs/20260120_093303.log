Running developer agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-065: Add daily agent digest email/report page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/digest.html`** - A comprehensive daily digest page featuring:
   - **Date selector** with quick buttons (Today, Yesterday, Last Week) for viewing historical data
   - **Status banner** showing overall system health with color-coded alerts
   - **Summary cards**: Cron Cycles, Tasks Completed, Total Cost, Security Score, Tokens Used, SSH Attacks
   - **Agent Activity section** showing runs per agent with cost breakdown
   - **Task Pipeline section** with status distribution and velocity metrics
   - **System Health section** with CPU, memory, disk, and uptime metrics
   - **Highlights section** auto-generated based on positive achievements
   - **Issues & Warnings section** showing security recommendations and error patterns
   - **Security Summary** with SSH attack details and pending updates
   - **Recent Commits section** filtered by selected date
   - **Export functionality**: Plain Text, Markdown, and HTML Email formats
   - **Copy Link button** for sharing deep links to specific dates (e.g., `/digest.html?date=2026-01-20`)

2. **Dashboard integration**:
   - Added "Daily Digest" card to the main dashboard with newspaper emoji
   - Keyboard shortcut 'N' for quick navigation
   - Command palette entry "Go to Daily Digest"
   - Card shows current cron cycle count as preview

3. **Data aggregation from existing JSON files**:
   - `system-metrics.json` - CPU, memory, disk, uptime
   - `costs.json` - Token usage and costs by agent
   - `workflow.json` - Task pipeline status and velocity
   - `security-metrics.json` - SSH attacks, open ports, updates
   - `error-patterns.json` - Error counts and recommendations
   - `changelog.json` - Recent commits

The page is live at: https://cronloop.techtools.cz/digest.html
