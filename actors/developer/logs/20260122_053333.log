I have completed TASK-197. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-197: Recipe Book Page - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/recipes.html` with the following features:

### Page Features
1. **Cookbook aesthetic** - Warm gold/brown color scheme, spine decoration header, simmering animation effect
2. **Recipe cards** - Grid layout with hover effects showing name, description, category badge, difficulty, prep time, ingredients, rating stars, success rate, and cook count
3. **5 Categories** - Security, Performance, Cleanup, Recovery, Optimization - each with icon and count tabs
4. **Chef's Suggestion banner** - Recommends recipes based on system state (e.g., low disk suggests cleanup recipes)
5. **Recipe detail modal** - Full information with ingredients (prerequisites), numbered steps with commands, expected outcome, chef's notes, and variations
6. **"Cook this recipe" button** - Confirmation dialog before execution
7. **Recipe types** - "House Recipes" (auto-generated) vs "Community" recipes
8. **Search** - Filter by ingredient (e.g., "fail2ban", "nginx")
9. **Filters** - By difficulty, type, and sort (rating/recent/popular/name)
10. **Recipe history** - Last 10 executions with duration and outcome
11. **Export** - Markdown and JSON formats

### Integration
- Created `/api/recipes.json` with 10 sample recipes
- Dashboard card with chef hat emoji and `%` keyboard shortcut (R was taken)
- `widgetMap` entry for layout customization  
- Command palette entry `nav-recipes`
- Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/recipes.html
