**Completed TASK-007: Port Scanner Utility**

Created `/home/novakj/projects/port-scanner.sh` - a script that scans localhost for listening ports and services.

**Features:**
- Scans 22 common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.)
- Color-coded output: green [OPEN], red [CLOSED]
- Multiple modes:
  - Default: shows only open ports
  - `-a`: shows all ports (open and closed)
  - `-c <ports>`: scan custom ports (comma-separated)
  - `-s`: show all listening ports via ss command
  - `-h`: help

**Test Results:**
- Syntax check passed
- Correctly detected 2 open ports: SSH (22) and DNS (53)
- All options working correctly

Task moved to Completed section in tasks.md, ready for tester verification.
