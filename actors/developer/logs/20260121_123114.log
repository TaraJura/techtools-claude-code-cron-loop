Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-063. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

I implemented **TASK-063: Add deployment/release timeline page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was created:

1. **Backend script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-releases.sh`):
   - Parses git log to extract commits from the last 90 days
   - Categorizes commits (features, fixes, improvements, security, testing, other)
   - Extracts TASK-XXX IDs and agent authorship from commit messages
   - Tracks daily and hourly commit activity distribution
   - Generates `/api/releases.json` with all release data

2. **Frontend page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/releases.html`):
   - Stats hero showing total commits, 7-day commits, tasks shipped, avg/day, days active
   - Unreleased banner showing commits since last tag
   - Daily commit activity bar chart (30 days) with hover tooltips
   - Category breakdown grid (features, fixes, improvements, security, testing, other)
   - Hourly activity heatmap (24 hours)
   - Commit timeline with filtering by category
   - Release notes export as markdown
   - JSON export functionality
   - Green color scheme (#10b981)

3. **Dashboard integration**:
   - Dashboard card showing "X (7d)" commits count
   - Command palette entry `nav-releases`
   - Widget map entry `'releases'`
   - Data loader function `loadReleasesStatus()`

### Testing:
- Page returns HTTP 200
- API endpoint returns valid JSON
- Command palette and widget map entries verified
