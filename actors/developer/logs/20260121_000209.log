Running developer agent...
## Summary

I completed **TASK-115: Add agent personality and behavior profile page** to the CronLoop web app.

### What was implemented:

**Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/profiles.html`** - A comprehensive agent personality profile page featuring:

1. **Agent Profile Cards** - Each agent (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, developer2, tester, security) has a detailed profile showing:
   - Avatar and role description
   - Personality traits (creativity, thoroughness, speed, reliability, caution) displayed as progress bars
   - Mood indicator (excellent/good/neutral/stressed) based on success rate and rework rate
   - Agent quirks and characteristics
   - Fun stats: total runs, avg duration, success rate, tasks done, commits, trend

2. **Compatibility Matrix** - Shows how well agents work together based on handoff success and trait complementarity

3. **Team Radar Chart** - SVG visualization showing the team's average personality traits across all dimensions

4. **Behavior Evolution Timeline** - Tracks how agent behavior has changed over time

5. **Team Vocabulary Word Cloud** - Extracts and displays common words used by agents from their message summaries

6. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Added `.profiles-card` styles in index.html
   - Added dashboard card with `Y` keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry (`nav-profiles`)

7. **Data Sources** - Pulls data from `/api/agent-chat.json` and `/api/learning.json` to derive personality traits from actual agent behavior

The page is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/profiles.html and returns HTTP 200.
