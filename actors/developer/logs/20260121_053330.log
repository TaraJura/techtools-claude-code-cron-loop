Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-089. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-089: Agent Failure Cascade Analyzer - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cascade.html` - a page that analyzes and visualizes how failures propagate through the multi-agent pipeline.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Resilience Score Hero** - Overall system resilience percentage with status badge (high/medium/low)

2. **Summary Stats Cards** - Cascade events count, average blast radius, recovery time, fragile vs resilient handoffs

3. **Pipeline Flow Visualization** - Interactive diagram showing agent dependency chain (idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → security) with:
   - Clickable nodes displaying failure rates
   - Animated arrows showing handoff health (healthy/risky/broken)
   - Nodes pulse red when failure rate is high

4. **Blast Radius Analysis Grid** - For each agent shows downstream agent count, propagation rate, expected impact with progress bars

5. **Handoff Resilience Matrix** - Table showing failure correlation percentages between all agent pairs with color coding

6. **What-If Simulation** - Select an agent and downtime duration to project impact (tasks blocked, agents affected, throughput loss, recovery time)

7. **Historical Cascade Timeline** - Past cascade events with root cause, affected agents, pattern type, and recovery status

8. **Resilience Recommendations** - Prioritized suggestions based on high failure rates, fragile handoffs, and high blast radius

9. **Export to JSON** - For postmortem integration

10. **Auto-refresh** every 5 minutes

The page fetches data from `/api/error-patterns.json` and `/api/agent-status.json` and is accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/cascade.html
