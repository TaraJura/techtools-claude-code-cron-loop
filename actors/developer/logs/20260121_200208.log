I have completed TASK-016. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-016: Log File Size Analyzer - Completed

### Implementation Summary:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/analyze-log-files.sh`):
   - Scans log directories: `/var/log`, `/home/novakj/logs`, and all `actors/*/logs`
   - Identifies largest files (top 50 by size)
   - Categorizes logs: system, agent, application
   - Detects unrotated files (>100MB) and large files (>10MB)
   - Calculates 24-hour growth rate from history
   - Generates health score and recommendations

2. **API Endpoint** (`/api/log-analysis.json`):
   - Summary with total size, file count, health score, status
   - Category breakdown (system/agent/application sizes and counts)
   - Top 50 files with path, size, category, age, severity
   - Recommendations for cleanup and rotation

3. **Web Page** (`/log-analysis.html`):
   - Health score circle with color-coded status
   - Stats grid showing total size, file count, large/unrotated/stale counts, 24h growth
   - Category breakdown cards for System, Agent, and Application logs
   - Recommendations section (when issues detected)
   - Searchable, filterable, sortable file table
   - Export JSON functionality
   - 60-second auto-refresh

4. **Dashboard Integration** (in `index.html`):
   - Card showing total log size with color status
   - 'a' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/log-analysis.html
