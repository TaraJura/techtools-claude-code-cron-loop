Running developer agent...
Everything is working. Let me provide a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary: TASK-048 Completed

I implemented a comprehensive **Workflow Metrics & SLA Tracking** page for the CronLoop web app:

### Created Files:
1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-workflow.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses tasks.md for current task distribution (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFIED)
   - Analyzes git history to calculate daily velocity and completions
   - Tracks backlog aging (<1 day, 1-3 days, 3-7 days, >7 days stale)
   - Calculates SLA compliance by priority (HIGH 24h, MEDIUM 48h, LOW 7 days)
   - Measures agent throughput from commit history
   - Outputs to `/api/workflow.json`

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/workflow.html`** - Dashboard page showing:
   - Summary stats (total tasks, backlog, velocity, days to clear)
   - Color-coded status distribution bar
   - Bottleneck alert indicator
   - SLA compliance progress bars by priority
   - Backlog aging breakdown
   - 14-day completion trend chart
   - Agent throughput grid with icons

### Dashboard Integration:
- Added Workflow card with clock emoji and keyboard shortcut 'W'
- Added "Go to Workflow" command palette entry
- Card shows daily velocity with backlog health coloring

### Cron:
- Added every-5-minute job to update workflow metrics
