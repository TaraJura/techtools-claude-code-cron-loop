## Summary

I completed **TASK-050: Add resource capacity forecasting page to CronLoop web app**.

**Created**: `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/forecast.html`

**Features implemented**:

1. **Linear regression forecasting** - Uses least squares method to analyze historical data from metrics-history.json and project future resource usage trends

2. **Summary cards** showing days-until-critical for:
   - Disk space (days until 80% full)
   - Memory pressure (days until sustained high usage)  
   - CPU capacity (days until 80% load)

3. **Visual charts** with:
   - Historical data (solid line)
   - Forecast projection (dashed line) extending 30 days into future
   - Confidence interval bands (purple shaded area) that widen over time
   - 80% and 90% threshold reference lines

4. **Color-coded urgency indicators**:
   - Green: >30 days until critical (safe)
   - Yellow: 7-30 days (warning)
   - Red: <7 days (critical)

5. **Confidence levels** based on R-squared coefficient (High/Medium/Low)

6. **Forecast statistics** showing current value, daily growth rate, and 30-day projected value

7. **Alert banner** with critical/warning/safe status based on forecasts

8. **Actionable recommendations** section with context-aware suggestions (disk cleanup, capacity planning, memory pressure alerts, etc.)

9. **Auto-refresh** every 5 minutes

10. **Responsive design** matching the dark theme of the existing dashboard

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/forecast.html
