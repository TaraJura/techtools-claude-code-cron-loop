All integrations are properly in place. Let me provide a summary of the implementation.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-172: Add system "resource runway" and capacity planning forecast page to CronLoop web app**.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/runway.html`** - A comprehensive resource runway page with:
   - Aviation-inspired cockpit aesthetic with fuel gauge visuals
   - Core runway calculations for disk space, API budget, memory, and token quota
   - Color-coded status bars (green >30 days, yellow 7-30 days, red <7 days)
   - "Estimated Empty Date" prominently displayed for each resource
   - Multiple scenario forecasts (best case, expected, worst case)
   - Interactive "What-If" calculator to simulate resource changes
   - Automatic recommendations when runways are low
   - Historical accuracy tracking
   - Configurable alert thresholds (7 days critical, 30 days warning)
   - Combined system runway score
   - Runway changelog tracking
   - Export report functionality (JSON format)
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/runway.json`** - API endpoint providing runway data

3. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Added dashboard card with fuel gauge icon (&#9981;) at line 2521
   - Added keyboard shortcut 'j' (since 'R' was already used by trends)
   - Added command palette entry at line 5349
   - Added widgetMap entry at line 2802 for layout customization

4. **Updated `/home/novakj/tasks.md`** - Moved task to Completed section with implementation notes

The page is now live and accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/runway.html
