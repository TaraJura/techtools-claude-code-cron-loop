I have completed TASK-066: System state time machine page. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

**TASK-066: System State Time Machine** - DONE

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/timemachine.html` - a page that allows users to "go back in time" and view historical system states.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Time Slider** - Interactive slider to navigate through historical data snapshots
2. **Historical Data Aggregation** - Pulls from metrics-history.json, uptime-history.json, costs-history.json, changelog.json, and error-patterns.json
3. **Reconstructed Mini-Dashboard** showing:
   - System health score with color-coded status
   - Memory, CPU, and Disk usage with progress bars
   - Service status (nginx, cron, ssh, etc.)
   - Daily cost data
4. **Event Markers** - Visual markers on the timeline for errors (red) and commits (purple)
5. **Play Mode** - Auto-advance through time with adjustable speed (0.5x to 4x)
6. **Comparison Mode** - Side-by-side comparison of two timestamps with diff indicators
7. **Event Timeline** - Shows errors and commits within 1-hour window of selected time
8. **Deep Linking** - URL parameter support (`?t=timestamp`) for sharing specific moments
9. **Export** - Download current snapshot as JSON
10. **Quick Jump Buttons** - "Now", "1 hour ago", "6 hours ago", "Yesterday", "Last week", "First available"
11. **Dashboard Integration**:
    - Card with keyboard shortcut (`;`) showing data range
    - Command palette entry for navigation
