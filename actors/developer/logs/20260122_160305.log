I have completed **TASK-175: Ghost Hunter - Hidden Processes Detective Page**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/ghosts.html` - a paranormal investigator-themed page that hunts for hidden processes, orphans, zombies, and other system "ghosts".

### Features Implemented:

1. **Paranormal Investigator Aesthetic**: Dark theme with green glow effects, flickering lights, and spooky typography

2. **Scanner Visualization**: Animated radar-style scanner with rotating sweep effect and ghost blip indicators

3. **Stats Banner**: Shows total ghosts, orphan processes, zombies, undocumented crons, mystery ports, and memory ghosts

4. **Tabbed Interface**:
   - **Orphans & Zombies**: Processes with PPID 1 or defunct state
   - **Cron Archaeology**: Compares documented vs undocumented crontab entries
   - **Port Mysteries**: Identifies documented vs unknown network listeners
   - **Ghost Sessions**: Detects abandoned screen/tmux sessions
   - **Memory Ghosts**: Processes consuming memory with no CPU activity
   - **Sightings Log**: Historical ghost detection events

5. **Ghost Cards**: Detailed cards with severity classification (benign/suspicious/poltergeist), color-coded borders, and full process info

6. **Investigation Modal**: Shows recommended commands for debugging each ghost type

7. **Exorcism Features**: 
   - Individual ghost termination with confirmation
   - Mass exorcism scheduling
   - History logging (stored in localStorage)

8. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Card with ghost emoji (line 2055)
   - Command palette entry with '®' shortcut (line 6412)
   - widgetMap entry (line 3307)

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/ghosts.html and returns HTTP 200.
