Running developer agent...
I've completed **TASK-126: Add feature ROI calculator and value tracker page to CronLoop web app**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

### 1. Backend Script (`/home/novakj/scripts/update-roi.sh`)
- Combines data from `cost-profiler.json` and `usage-analytics.json`
- Calculates ROI metrics for each feature/page:
  - Development cost (from token usage)
  - Usage value (from page visits)
  - ROI ratio, cost-per-visit, break-even visits
  - Efficiency score
- Generates recommendations for:
  - Features to sunset (expensive + low usage)
  - Patterns to learn from (cheap + popular)
  - Features needing promotion (ghost pages with potential)
- Outputs to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/roi.json`

### 2. Web Page (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/roi.html`)
- **ROI Summary Banner**: Shows overall system ROI ratio with breakdown
- **Summary Cards**: High/Medium/Low/Negative ROI counts, best/worst performers
- **Cost vs Value Scatter Plot**: Interactive matrix with quadrants (cheap+valuable, expensive+unused, etc.)
- **Tabbed Views**:
  - All Features: Cards with dev cost, visits, break-even, efficiency bar
  - High ROI: Features performing well
  - Negative ROI: Features needing attention
  - Recommendations: Actionable suggestions
  - Trends: 7-day ROI trend chart
- **Export**: JSON and CSV download buttons

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- Added dashboard card linking to `/roi.html`
- Card shows current ROI ratio (e.g., "0.28x ROI")
- Keyboard shortcut: `}` (closing curly brace)
- Command palette entry for quick navigation
- CSS styling with green/emerald theme
- Auto-refresh with other dashboard data
