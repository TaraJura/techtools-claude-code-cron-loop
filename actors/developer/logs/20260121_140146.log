Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-061. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-061 - Agent Workload Balancer Visualization

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **Backend Script**: `/home/novakj/scripts/update-workload.sh`
   - Parses tasks.md for queue depths per agent
   - Analyzes agent logs for throughput and utilization metrics
   - Generates recommendations for bottlenecks and idle agents

2. **API Endpoint**: `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/workload.json`
   - Summary stats (pipeline_health, total_throughput_7d, bottleneck_agent)
   - Per-agent metrics (queue_depth, runs_today, runs_7d, runs_30d, avg_duration_sec, utilization_pct)
   - Pipeline flow data for funnel visualization
   - Hourly distribution for today's activity
   - Recommendations array

3. **Web Page**: `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/workload.html`
   - Pipeline health gauge (0-100%)
   - Pipeline funnel visualization showing throughput per stage
   - Agent workload cards with queue depth, runs, and utilization
   - Hourly activity heatmap
   - Recommendations section

4. **Dashboard Integration** in `index.html`:
   - Dashboard card with amber color (#f59e0b) showing pipeline health
   - Command palette entry: `nav-workload` with `b` keyboard shortcut
   - Widget map entry: `'workload': 'a[href="workload.html"]'`
   - Data loader function: `loadWorkloadStatus()`

The task has been moved to the Completed section in tasks.md with status DONE.
