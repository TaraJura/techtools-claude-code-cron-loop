I have completed **TASK-137**. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## TASK-137 Completed: Heartbeat Signature Page

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/signature.html` - a behavioral fingerprinting and drift detection page for autonomous system integrity monitoring.

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **EKG/Medical Monitor Aesthetic** - Grid background, scanline animations, and Courier monospace font
2. **Status Banner** - Shows overall drift score (0-100%), baseline age, components tracked, active alerts, and lock mode
3. **Six Signature Components Tracked**:
   - Cron Execution Timing (30-minute cycle precision)
   - Agent Run Duration (per-agent execution time patterns)
   - Disk I/O Rhythm (write burst patterns)
   - Network Traffic Pattern (API calls to Anthropic)
   - File Access Sequence (which files touched in what order)
   - Memory Allocation Pattern (RSS per agent)

4. **Radar Chart Visualization** - Shows current vs baseline conformance with color-coded points
5. **EKG Line Animations** - Each component has an animated heartbeat pattern
6. **Drift Alerts** - Warning/critical severity badges with detailed messages
7. **Historical Timeline** - 30-day SVG line chart showing drift evolution
8. **Compare Feature** - Compare today's signature with any historical date
9. **Signature Lock Mode** - Freeze baseline and alert on ANY deviation
10. **Export Options** - Export full signature JSON or baseline only
11. **Dashboard Integration**:
    - Card with 📊 icon and ° keyboard shortcut
    - Command palette entry
    - widgetMap entry for layout customization
12. **API Endpoint** - `/api/signature.json` with components, history, and alerts data
