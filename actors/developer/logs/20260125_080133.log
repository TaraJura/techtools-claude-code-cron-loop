## Summary

**TASK-267 Completed**: Applied shared-hub-styles.css to remaining hub pages for consistency

**What was done:**
- Added `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/shared-hub-styles.css">` import to all 27 remaining hub/center pages
- Total: 29 pages now use the shared CSS (including the 2 that were already refactored)

**Pages updated:**
- achievements-hub.html, agent-hub.html, alerting-hub.html, analytics-hub.html, code-hub.html
- config-center.html, creative-corner.html, docs-hub.html, financial-center.html, growth-hub.html
- health-center.html, infrastructure-hub.html, insights-hub.html, interaction-hub.html
- log-analysis-hub.html, navigation-hub.html, operations-hub.html, optimization-hub.html
- predictions-hub.html, process-center.html, resilience-hub.html, security-center.html
- self-reflection-hub.html, situational-awareness-hub.html, story-hub.html, task-hub.html, time-explorer.html

**Verification:**
- All 30 HTML pages validated (valid DOCTYPE)
- All pages return HTTP 200 via HTTPS
- Shared CSS file accessible at /css/shared-hub-styles.css (870 lines)

**Benefits:**
- Consistent styling via shared CSS variables
- Browser caching of 870 lines of shared CSS
- Easier future theme updates
- Foundation for further inline CSS cleanup

**Page count:** 30 HTML pages (unchanged - this was an optimization task, not a consolidation)
