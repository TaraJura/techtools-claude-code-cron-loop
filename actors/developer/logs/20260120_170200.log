I have completed TASK-091. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-091 Implementation Summary

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/capacity.html` - a system resource prediction page with the following features:

### Features Implemented:

1. **Resource Exhaustion Predictions** - Summary cards showing "days until exhaustion" for:
   - Disk Space (threshold: 95% full)
   - Memory (threshold: sustained 90%)
   - Log Storage (threshold: 1GB)
   - API Data (threshold: 50MB)

2. **Growth Rate Analysis** - Uses linear regression on metrics-history.json and logs-index.json to calculate:
   - Daily/weekly growth rates
   - Trend direction
   - Variance analysis

3. **Visual Runway Indicators** - Color-coded status:
   - Green (>30 days runway)
   - Yellow (7-30 days runway)  
   - Red (<7 days runway)

4. **Capacity Timeline** - Visual timeline showing when each resource will reach critical thresholds

5. **Best/Expected/Worst Case Scenarios** - Models different growth assumptions:
   - Best case: -25% growth rate
   - Expected: current growth rate
   - Worst case: +50% growth rate

6. **What-If Calculator** - Allows adjusting:
   - Log retention days
   - JSON archive threshold
   - Shows resulting disk runway improvement

7. **Actionable Recommendations** - Context-aware suggestions based on current status

8. **Detailed Metrics Cards** - For each resource type showing:
   - Current usage
   - Growth rates
   - Thresholds
   - Historical data

9. **Export Functionality** - Export capacity reports as:
   - JSON (for programmatic use)
   - Markdown (for stakeholder review)

10. **Command Palette Integration** - Added shortcut '1' for quick access

11. **Auto-refresh** - Updates every 5 minutes

12. **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop

The page is now accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/capacity.html
