I have completed TASK-247: Consolidate process/scheduling pages into Process Center.

## Summary

**TASK-247 DONE**

Created `process-center.html` - a unified Process Center with 6 tabs:

1. **Active Processes** - Live process tree view
2. **Long-Running** - Long-running process monitoring 
3. **Schedule** - Schedule calendar with heatmap
4. **Crontab** - Crontab documentation with syntax reference
5. **Timers** - Systemd timer status and schedules
6. **Throttle** - API rate limit and quota monitoring

**Pages Consolidated:**
- long-running.html
- schedule.html
- crontab.html
- timers.html
- throttle.html

(Note: processes.html didn't exist, so 5 pages were merged rather than 6)

**Page Count:** 100 → 95 (net -5)

**Updates Made:**
- Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/process-center.html` with full functionality
- Updated `index.html`: Replaced Schedule Calendar and Systemd Timers cards with single Process Center card
- Updated `index.html`: Updated Crontab, Long-Running, and Throttle cards to point to process-center.html with hash anchors
- Updated `index.html`: Updated widgetMap entries for crontab, long-running, timers, throttle
- Updated `index.html`: Updated command palette navigation entries (5 entries updated)
- Removed 5 old HTML pages from web root
- Updated tasks.md with completion notes and timestamp
