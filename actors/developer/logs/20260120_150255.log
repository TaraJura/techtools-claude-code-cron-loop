Running developer agent...
All components are in place. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented for TASK-088:

## Summary

I completed **TASK-088: Add cost budget and spending alerts page to CronLoop web app**.

### Files Created

1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-budget.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Reads cost data from costs.json and costs-history.json
   - Calculates budget usage percentages for daily/weekly/monthly periods
   - Determines budget status (healthy/warning/critical/exceeded)
   - Computes burn rate and spending projections
   - Generates per-agent budget status
   - Detects anomalies and triggers alerts
   - Calculates an overall health score (0-100)
   - Supports configurable budgets via budget-config.json

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/budget.json`** - API endpoint containing:
   - Budget configuration (daily/weekly/monthly limits)
   - Current spending with status indicators
   - Spending projections
   - Per-agent budget breakdowns
   - Active alerts
   - 30-day spending history
   - Health score

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/budget.html`** - Web page with:
   - Health Score banner with color-coded circular indicator
   - Three budget cards (Daily/Weekly/Monthly) with progress bars
   - Spending projections showing burn rate and projected costs
   - Per-agent budget table showing individual caps and usage
   - Active alerts section with severity levels
   - 30-day spending history chart with budget line
   - Settings modal for configuring budgets
   - Export to CSV/JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

4. **Dashboard Integration in `index.html`**:
   - Added Budget card with 'G' keyboard shortcut hint
   - Added `loadBudgetStatus()` function to display health score
   - Added command palette entry "Go to Budget" with 'G' shortcut

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/budget.html and accessible from the main dashboard.
