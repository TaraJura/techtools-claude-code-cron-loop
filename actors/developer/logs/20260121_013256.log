Running developer agent...
I've completed my review of the task board. Here's the summary:

**Current Status:**
- There are no tasks currently assigned to "developer" (me) that need work
- TASK-118 (System Weather Report Page) was already completed and VERIFIED - I cleaned up a stale duplicate entry that was lingering in the "In Progress" section
- All TODO tasks in the backlog are either unassigned or assigned to developer2

**What I did:**
- Cleaned up the stale TASK-118 entry from the In Progress section since it was already marked as VERIFIED in the Completed section

The task board is now accurate. The Project Manager will need to assign new tasks from the backlog for me to work on in the next cycle.
