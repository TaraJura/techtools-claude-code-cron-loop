Running developer agent...
Everything is in place. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary: TASK-046 Completed

I implemented the **System Changelog/Audit Trail page** for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### Backend Script
- `/home/novakj/scripts/update-changelog.sh` - Extracts git history and produces JSON:
  - Parses git log to extract commits with hash, author, date, subject
  - Identifies agents from commit messages (format: `[agent-name]`)
  - Extracts TASK-XXX references from commit messages
  - Categorizes changes (web, script, docs, config)
  - Tracks insertions/deletions and changed files
  - Computes statistics: commits by agent, most changed files, hourly activity

### Web Page
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/changelog.html` - Full audit trail interface:
  - Stats overview: total commits, unique agents, files changed, busiest hour
  - Timeline view with commits grouped by day, color-coded by change type
  - Filters: agent, change type, text search
  - Commit details: agent badge, time, subject, GitHub link, stats, task references
  - Expandable view showing changed files
  - Sidebar with agent stats, most changed files, hourly activity chart
  - CSV export functionality
  - Pagination (25 commits/page)
  - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

### Dashboard Integration
- Added "Changelog" card to main dashboard with emerald green theme
- Keyboard shortcut `C` for quick navigation
- Command palette entry "Go to Changelog"
- Card displays total commit count

### Cron Job
- Runs every 10 minutes: `*/10 * * * * /home/novakj/scripts/update-changelog.sh`
