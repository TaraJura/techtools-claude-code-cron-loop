Running developer agent...
I've completed TASK-222. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-222: Bus Factor Analysis Page - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/bus-factor.html` with a comprehensive risk assessment aesthetic featuring:

**Features implemented:**
1. **Risk Overview Cards** - Shows critical/high/medium/low risk counts at a glance
2. **Overall Score Gauge** - Visual gauge with needle showing bus factor score (0-4), with interpretation and top recommendations
3. **Pipeline Critical Path Analysis** - Shows the agent pipeline flow with critical nodes highlighted (tester and project-manager marked as single points of failure)
4. **Four tabs:**
   - **Knowledge Silos** - File ownership analysis showing which files have concentrated ownership
   - **Agent Redundancy** - Shows backup coverage percentage for each agent and their available backups
   - **What If Analysis** - Simulates impact if each agent disappeared (tasks blocked, files orphaned, pipeline breaks, recovery time)
   - **Risk Heatmap** - Clickable grid showing file criticality vs ownership concentration
5. **Diversification Recommendations** - Prioritized suggestions for reducing bus factor risk

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Dashboard card with warning icon and `[` keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry for quick navigation
- widgetMap entry for layout customization

Note: The task originally specified 'F' for keyboard shortcut, but that was already used by forecast.html and focus.html, so I used '[' instead.
