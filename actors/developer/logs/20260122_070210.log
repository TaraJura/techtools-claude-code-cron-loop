The page is live. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-202 Completed

I implemented the **Feature Journey Tracker** (breadcrumbs.html) for the CronLoop web app. Here's what was created:

### `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/breadcrumbs.html`

**Visual Design:**
- Forest path aesthetic with animated fireflies, swaying trees, and lantern glow effects
- Green/brown color scheme evoking a woodland trail
- Gradient backgrounds and glowing waypoint markers

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Stats Grid**: Total journeys, completed, in-progress, lost count, avg duration, fastest journey
2. **Journey Trail Visualization**: Each task shows as a path with waypoints for idea-maker → PM → developer → tester → deployed
3. **Waypoint Markers**: Color-coded by agent with current/reached/pending states
4. **Lost in Woods Detection**: Tasks stuck too long get red pulsing indicator
5. **Transformation Tracking**: Side-by-side diff showing original idea vs final implementation
6. **Four Tabs**:
   - All Journeys: Main list with filtering/sorting
   - Failed Journeys (Graveyard): Tombstones for features that didn't make it
   - Statistics: Stage time charts, handoff frequency, records
   - Compare: Side-by-side journey comparison
7. **Search & Filters**: By task ID/title, status, agent, sort order
8. **Export**: JSON export of journey data
9. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Card with yarn emoji (🧶) and '«' keyboard shortcut (J was taken by schedule.html)
- Command palette entry for navigation
- widgetMap entry for layout customization

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/breadcrumbs.html
