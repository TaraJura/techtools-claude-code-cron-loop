I have completed TASK-203. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-203 Complete: Context Tax Analyzer

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/context-tax.html` - a comprehensive page that analyzes the hidden "context tax" paid by agents when switching between different task types.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Tax/Accounting Visual Theme**: Ledger lines animation, receipt-style breakdowns, red/black accounting colors

2. **Summary Dashboard**: 5 metric cards showing:
   - Total Context Tax (tokens)
   - Context Switches count
   - Avg Tax Per Switch
   - Best Focus Streak
   - Tax Refunds (switches that led to breakthroughs)

3. **Seven Interactive Tabs**:
   - **Switch Matrix**: Heatmap showing token overhead for all category transitions
   - **Agent Penalties**: Grade cards (A-D) for each agent's multitasking efficiency
   - **Tax Brackets**: Visualization of cognitive similarity zones (Development, Quality, Support)
   - **Timeline**: Real-time context switch log with tax annotations
   - **Focus Metrics**: Focus streak tracking per agent with deep work scores
   - **Daily Summary**: Weekly trend chart + hourly distribution
   - **Tax Strategies**: Automated optimization recommendations with potential savings

4. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with calculator emoji and `¢` keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization

5. **Export Options**: JSON export and Markdown tax report generation
