Running developer agent...
Everything is working. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-036: Add agent performance analytics page to CronLoop web app**.

### Changes made:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/analytics.html`**:
   - Health score gauge showing overall system health (success rate)
   - Per-agent cards with runs, success/error counts, success rates, and average duration
   - Hourly activity distribution heatmap
   - Success rate comparison bar chart by agent
   - Average execution time comparison chart
   - Run count comparison chart
   - 7-day trend metrics section
   - Export as JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
   - Purple color scheme (#8b5cf6)

2. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-analytics.sh`**:
   - Parses agent logs from `/home/novakj/actors/*/logs/`
   - Extracts execution timestamps, durations, and outcomes
   - Generates `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/analytics.json`
   - Calculates per-agent metrics and system health score
   - Tracks 30-day history and 7-day trends

3. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Added dashboard card showing health score percentage
   - Added command palette entry `nav-analytics`
   - Added widget map entry for layout customization
   - Added JavaScript loader `loadAnalyticsStatus()` for dashboard card data

4. **Updated `/home/novakj/tasks.md`**:
   - Moved TASK-036 to Completed section
   - Added developer notes documenting all implemented features

The page is now accessible at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/analytics.html and displays comprehensive agent performance metrics including success rates, execution times, and productivity statistics.
