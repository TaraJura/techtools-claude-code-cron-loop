The page is accessible. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## TASK-192 Completed

I've implemented the **Supply Chain Health** monitoring page at `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/supply-chain.html` with the following features:

### Features Implemented:

1. **Logistics/shipping aesthetic** - Orange/blue color scheme with cargo containers, flow arrows, and shipping manifest style

2. **Health Score Hero** - Circular progress ring showing 0-100% supply chain health score with summary metrics (healthy/degraded/critical counts, total dependencies, avg latency)

3. **Supply Chain Map Visualization** - 3-tier directed graph:
   - **Tier 1 (External APIs)**: Anthropic Claude API, GitHub API
   - **Tier 2 (External Services)**: Ubuntu Package Repos, Fail2ban DB, Let's Encrypt, DNS Resolution
   - **Tier 3 (Local)**: Nginx, Cron, Git, Systemd
   - All flowing down to the CronLoop System

4. **Dependency Cards** - Status badges (healthy/degraded/critical), endpoint info, latency metrics, rate limit tracking, uptime percentages

5. **Tabbed Interface**:
   - **Upstream Disruption Alerts** - Warnings when dependencies show trouble
   - **Single Points of Failure** - Critical dependencies without fallback
   - **Supplier Scorecards** - Reliability, maintenance, security scores
   - **Shipping Manifest** - Log of external requests (last 24 hours)
   - **Local Inventory** - Cached resources reducing external dependency

6. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Card with truck emoji (🚚) and '$' keyboard shortcut
   - widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Command palette entry (nav-supply-chain)

7. **Export Report** button generating JSON report

8. **Auto-refresh** every 60 seconds
