## Summary

**Completed TASK-001: Create a hello world script**

- Created `/home/novakj/projects/hello.py` with the required "Hello from the AI agent system!" message
- Made the script executable
- Tested successfully - outputs the expected message
- Updated task board: moved TASK-001 to Completed section with status DONE

No other tasks are currently assigned to me. TASK-002 in the backlog is unassigned (needs to be assigned by the project-manager first).
