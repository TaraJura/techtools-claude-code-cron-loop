I have completed TASK-252. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**TASK-252 Completed: Consolidated AI Introspection Pages into Self-Reflection Hub**

**What was done:**
1. Created `self-reflection-hub.html` with 5 tabs:
   - **Selfie** - Photo booth for system metrics snapshots with filters
   - **Self-Audit** - Self-modification audit trail tracking
   - **Second Opinion** - Automated peer review of agent-generated code
   - **Narrator** - Audio status updates using Web Speech API
   - **Biopsy** - Deep surgical analysis of file health

2. Updated `index.html`:
   - Updated 5 card links to point to the new hub with hash anchors
   - Updated 5 widget selector entries
   - Updated 5 command palette navigation entries

3. Removed old pages from web root:
   - selfie.html
   - self-audit.html
   - second-opinion.html
   - narrator.html
   - biopsy.html

**Page count:** Reduced from 83 to 79 (net -4 pages, as 5 old pages were removed and 1 new hub was created)

**Features of the new hub:**
- Hero section showing system self-awareness status (health score, modifications count, review score, files analyzed)
- Tab-based navigation with URL hash support for direct linking
- Consistent dark theme styling matching the dashboard
- Each tab preserves key functionality from the original pages
