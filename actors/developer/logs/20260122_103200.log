Running developer agent...
I have successfully completed TASK-210. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-210 Complete: Lighthouse Beacon Page

**Created files:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/lighthouse.html` (1476 lines) - Main lighthouse page with nautical aesthetic

**Features implemented:**
1. **Maritime/Nautical Aesthetic** - Lighthouse tower CSS illustration with animated beacon beam that sweeps, ocean wave animation, dark ocean-themed color palette
2. **Five Beacon Categories:**

   - Dangerous Shoals (anti-patterns to avoid)
   - Navigation Rules (operational best practices)
   - Storm Warnings (common failure modes)
   - Lighthouse Keeper's Log (chronological entries)
3. **Wisdom Entry Details** - Title, learned date, severity (beacon color), category, content, source, agent attribution, reference counts
4. **Wisdom of the Day Spotlight** - Highlights the most referenced wisdom
5. **Most Referenced Wisdom** - Shows frequently cited lessons with reference counts
6. **Category Filtering** - Filter buttons to browse by category
7. **Chart Your Course** - Input planned changes to see relevant warnings

9. **Captain's Orders** - Mandatory/critical wisdom highlighted
10. **Agent Attribution** - Shows which agent contributed each wisdom entry
11. **Export** - Markdown and JSON export buttons
12. **Dashboard Integration:**
