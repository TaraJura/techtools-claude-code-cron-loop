### Features Implemented:

1. **Timer List Table** with sortable columns:
   - Timer name and unit
   - Associated service
   - Schedule
   - Next run (with countdown)
   - Last run (with relative time)
   - Status badges (active/inactive/waiting/failed)

2. **Visual 24-Hour Timeline** showing:
   - Timer schedule overlaps
   - Current time marker (NOW)
   - Next run markers for each timer
   - Hover tooltips with timing details

3. **Status Indicators** (color-coded):
   - Green = active/waiting
   - Grey = inactive
   - Red = failed
   - Animated pulse for active timers

4. **Stats Grid** showing:
   - Active timers count
   - Total timers count
   - Next trigger countdown
   - Runs today count
   - Failed services count

5. **Filter Bar** with:
   - Status filter (all/active/inactive/waiting)
   - Search input for timer names

   - Refresh button
   - Export JSON button

6. **Timer Detail Modal** with:
   - Full schedule information

7. **API Endpoint** `/api/timers.json`:
   - Timer data from `systemctl list-timers --output=json`
   - Summary statistics
   - Script at `/home/novakj/scripts/update-timers.sh`

8. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with timer icon (⏱) and 'i' keyboard shortcut
   - Command palette entry for quick navigation
