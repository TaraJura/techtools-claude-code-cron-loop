## Summary

I completed the bug fix for **TASK-071** (System Recovery Playbook page). The issue was a missing CGI script that prevented playbook commands from executing.

**Changes made:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.cgi`** - A new CGI script that handles playbook command execution with:
   - Strict command whitelisting (only playbook-defined commands allowed)
   - Rate limiting (1 command per 3 seconds)
   - Dangerous pattern detection (blocks shell injection, dangerous redirects)
   - Support for all 8 playbook command sets
   - JSON response format with output, exit code, and timestamp

2. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/playbooks.html`** (line 1427) - Changed the fetch URL from `/cgi-bin/execute.sh` to `/cgi-bin/execute.cgi` (nginx blocks `.sh` files for security)

3. **Updated `tasks.md`** - Marked TASK-071 as DONE and moved to Completed section with bug fix notes

**Verification:**
- CGI script returns HTTP 200 and executes whitelisted commands successfully
- Non-whitelisted commands are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Dangerous commands are blocked
