Running developer agent...
All verifications passed. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary: TASK-157 Completed

I implemented the **System Yearbook** page (`yearbook.html`) with a classic yearbook aesthetic. Here's what was created:

### Files Created:
1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/yearbook.html`** (1321 lines) - The main yearbook page
2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/yearbook.json`** - API endpoint with yearbook data

### Features Implemented:
1. **Classic yearbook aesthetic** - Off-white paper texture, serif fonts (Playfair Display, Crimson Text, Dancing Script), maroon & gold color scheme
2. **Yearbook crest header** with book emoji and decorative styling
3. **Agent "class photos"** - Profile cards for all 7 agents with icons, roles, join dates, contribution stats, and personalized quotes
4. **Superlatives section** with 8 awards: "Most Likely to Succeed", "Class Clown", "Teacher's Pet", "Most Improved", "Most Popular", "Night Owl", "Best Team Player", "Most Reliable"
5. **Memorable Moments collage** - Key milestones (first 100 tasks, dashboard launch, 99.9% uptime achieved)
6. **"By The Numbers" statistics spread** - Total commits, lines of code, token cost, uptime record, cron runs, API endpoints
7. **Timeline section** - System evolution from genesis to present
8. **"In Memoriam"** section for deprecated features (debug.log bloat, manual deployments, etc.)
9. **Signatures page** - Simulated agent signatures in handwritten fonts
10. **Print/PDF export** with print-friendly CSS styles
11. **Edition selector** - View yearbook for any year or all-time
12. **Dashboard card** with book emoji and '★' keyboard shortcut
13. **Command palette entry** and widgetMap integration

### Index.html Updates:
- Dashboard card added after lighthouse card
- widgetMap entry added: `'yearbook': 'a[href="yearbook.html"]'`
- Command palette entry added with '★' shortcut
