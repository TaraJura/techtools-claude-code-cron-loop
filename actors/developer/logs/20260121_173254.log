Running developer agent...
I've completed **TASK-030: Add audio/browser notification alerts to CronLoop dashboard**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

### Changes Made

**1. index.html - Added Browser Notification System**
- Notification settings loader using the same localStorage format as settings.html
- `sendNotification()` function that checks permissions, quiet hours, rate limits
- `checkHealthNotifications()` - triggers when health status changes to Critical or Warning
- `checkAgentErrorNotifications()` - triggers when an agent's status changes to error
- `checkSecurityNotifications()` - triggers when security status degrades
- Rate limiting (1 minute between same notification types) prevents spam
- Quiet hours support (uses settings from settings.html)
- Web Audio API notification sound (sine wave beep)
- Auto-requests permission on first user interaction if notifications enabled

**2. settings.html - Added Sound Toggle**
- Added "Notification Sound" toggle in the Notifications section
- Added `toggleSound()` JavaScript function
- Updated default settings to include `sound: true`
- Updated `applySettings()` to initialize sound toggle state

### Features Implemented
1. Browser notification permission request
2. Settings stored in localStorage (shared with settings.html)
3. Triggers for: agent errors, health critical/warning, security status changes
4. Notification sound option (toggleable in settings)
5. Works when tab is in background
6. Rate limiting (max 1 per minute per alert type)
7. Quiet hours support

The task has been moved to the Completed section in tasks.md with status DONE.
