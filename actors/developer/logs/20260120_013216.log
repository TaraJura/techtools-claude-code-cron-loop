## Summary

I've completed **TASK-037: Add backup status dashboard page to CronLoop web app**.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/backup-status.sh`** - A script that generates JSON API with:
   - Backup count and list of archives
   - File sizes (human-readable and bytes)
   - Health status (ok/warning/critical based on backup age)
   - List of files included in backups
   - Disk usage statistics
   - Retention policy info

2. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/backups.html`** - Comprehensive backup management page featuring:
   - Health Status hero section showing backup health (ok=green, warning=yellow, critical=red)
   - Stats grid: backup count, total size, last backup age, files included
   - "Create Backup Now" button integrated with Quick Actions system
   - Backup history list with sizes, dates, and "LATEST" badge
   - Files included section categorized by type (system/user/project)
   - Retention policy display (keeps last 5)
   - Disk usage bar visualization
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
   - Responsive design for mobile

3. **Added `create_backup` action type** to Quick Actions:
   - Updated `queue-action.sh` with new valid action
   - Updated `action-processor.sh` to run config-backup.sh and refresh status

4. **Updated main dashboard** (`index.html`):
   - Added Backups card with orange theme
   - Shows backup count with health-based color coding
   - Links to the backup status page

5. **Added cron job** (`*/10 * * * *`) to update backup-status.json every 10 minutes
