Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-131. Let me summarize what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-131 - Agent Conversation Cost Breakdown Dialog

Implemented a reusable cost breakdown dialog system that provides granular cost transparency for individual agent runs. The feature adds clickable "$ Cost" buttons to:

**Files created:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/js/cost-breakdown-dialog.js` - Shared JavaScript module (self-initializing, CSS-injecting)

**Files modified:**
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/timeline.html` - Added cost button to session cards, included script reference
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/logs.html` - Added cost button to log entry headers, included script reference  
- `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/communications.html` - Added cost button to agent stat cards with function to open most recent log, included script reference
- `/home/novakj/tasks.md` - Updated task status to DONE and moved to Completed section

**Features implemented:**
1. Modal dialog with total cost and comparison to agent average (cheaper/average/expensive badge)
2. Token breakdown grid showing input/output tokens with costs
3. Visual token bar chart showing input vs output ratio
4. Cost by category breakdown (system prompt, user message, tool responses, assistant output)
5. Tool call costs table showing top 15 most expensive operations sorted by cost
6. Cost drivers section identifying patterns (high tool volume, many file reads, substantial output)
7. Optimization recommendations with estimated savings
8. Export as JSON button
9. Caching of parsed cost data
10. Purple theme (#a855f7) matching cost-related pages
11. Responsive design with mobile breakpoints
12. Keyboard support (Escape to close)
