I've completed TASK-217. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-217: Doomsday Clock - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/doomsday.html` - a comprehensive catastrophic risk countdown page with:

**Clock Visualization:**
- Central animated clock face with minute hand that smoothly rotates based on risk level
- Hour markers and labels styled in atomic age typography
- Time displayed as "11:XX PM" format showing minutes to midnight

**Risk Factor Aggregation (7 sources):**
- Disk space (>90% = +3 min, >80% = +2 min, >70% = +1 min)
- Error rate thresholds
- Security threats/attack counts
- Failed tasks count
- Budget usage percentage
- Uptime percentage (inverse)
- Backup age in days

**Visual Indicators:**
- Warning banners: yellow at 15 min, red at 5 min, critical/flashing at 2 min
- Risk factor breakdown with color-coded severity badges
- "Nuclear winter" mode overlay when midnight is reached

**Features:**
- Scientists' Statement - AI-generated assessment that changes based on risk level
- "Move the clock back" recommendations dynamically generated
- Historical clock positions chart (7-day SVG graph)
- Survival time estimate
- Ticking sound toggle (Web Audio API) that speeds up near midnight
- Share clock position button
- Best/worst historical comparison

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Dashboard card with skull emoji (☠) and radioactive symbol (☢) keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry
- WidgetMap entry for layout customization
- CSS styles for doomsday-card
- Dashboard value loader fetching real risk data from APIs

The page is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/doomsday.html
