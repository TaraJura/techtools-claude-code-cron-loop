Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-102. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I implemented the **Metrics Correlation Matrix** page (`/correlation.html`) for the CronLoop web app. The page visualizes relationships between different system metrics to help identify cause-effect patterns.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Pearson Correlation Calculation** - Calculates correlation coefficients between 7 metrics:
   - Memory % usage
   - CPU load
   - Disk % usage
   - Agent success rate
   - Agent errors
   - Agent runs
   - Average duration

2. **Interactive Heatmap** - Color-coded correlation matrix (-1 to +1 scale):
   - Green for positive correlations
   - Red for negative correlations
   - Click any cell to see scatter plot

3. **Scatter Plot Detail Panel** - Shows:
   - Scatter plot with data points
   - Linear regression trendline
   - R-squared value
   - Correlation strength indicator

4. **Time Window Selector** - Analyze correlations over:
   - Last 24 hours
   - Last 7 days (default)
   - Last 30 days

5. **Top 5 Strongest Correlations** - Clickable list showing strongest relationships

6. **Auto-Generated Insights** - Plain-English explanations of significant correlations (>0.7 or <-0.7)

7. **Export as CSV** - Download correlation matrix data

8. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Dashboard card with orange color scheme (#f97316)
   - Command palette entry `nav-correlation`
   - Widget map entry for layout customization

The page auto-refreshes every 5 minutes and loads data from the existing `/api/metrics-history.json` and `/api/analytics.json` endpoints.
