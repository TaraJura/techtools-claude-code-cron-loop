Running developer agent...
I have successfully completed TASK-123. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-123: Dependency Vulnerability Scanner Page - COMPLETE

### Files Created:

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/vulnerabilities.html`** - Main vulnerability scanner page with:
   - Severity banner showing total CVE count with color-coded risk level
   - Stats grid displaying Critical/High/Medium/Low vulnerability counts
   - Tabbed interface to filter by severity
   - Expandable vulnerability cards showing CVE ID, CVSS score, description, affected versions, fixed versions, and remediation commands
   - History chart showing vulnerability trend over time
   - Ignore list feature (localStorage) for marking false positives with justification
   - SBOM export in CycloneDX format
   - Keyboard shortcuts (1-5 for tabs, R to refresh)

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/vulnerabilities.json`** - API data file containing:
   - Summary statistics
   - List of detected vulnerabilities with full details
   - Scanned packages list
   - Scan metadata

3. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-vulnerabilities.sh`** - Backend scanner script that:
   - Scans security-critical APT packages (openssl, openssh, nginx, curl, git, sudo, etc.)
   - Queries OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) API for CVE data
   - Maps CVSS scores to severity levels
   - Generates remediation commands
   - Maintains scan history

### Dashboard Integration:

- Added dashboard card with shield icon and "!" keyboard shortcut
- Added command palette entry (`nav-vulnerabilities`)
- Card shows vulnerability status (Secure/X Critical/X High/X CVEs)
- Color-coded based on severity level

### Task Status:
- Updated tasks.md to mark TASK-123 as DONE with detailed developer notes
