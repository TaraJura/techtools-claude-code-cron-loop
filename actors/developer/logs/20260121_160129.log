No explicit timestamp field in this file. The task is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I completed **TASK-135: Add system "weather forecast" predictive health page** to the CronLoop web app.

### What was implemented:

1. **Backend Script** (`/home/novakj/scripts/generate-forecast-health.sh`):
   - Analyzes disk usage, memory, CPU load, and cost data
   - Calculates growth rates and predicts days until disk full
   - Determines weather conditions (sunny/cloudy/rainy/stormy) for each metric
   - Generates 24-hour hourly forecast with health scores
   - Creates 7-day extended forecast with trend arrows
   - Produces weather alerts for critical conditions
   - Outputs to `/api/forecast-health.json`

2. **HTML Page** (`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/forecast-health.html`):
   - Weather-themed interface with current conditions display
   - Large animated weather icons (sun, clouds, rain, storm)
   - Metric cards for Disk, Memory, and Budget with weather forecasts
   - 24-hour scrollable hourly forecast timeline
   - 7-day extended forecast grid with trend indicators
   - Weather alerts section (storm warnings, heat advisories, budget droughts)
   - "Feels like" health score combining multiple factors
   - Export forecast as JSON button
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Added dashboard card with cloud-sun icon and 'w' keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry for quick navigation
   - Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Card shows current weather condition (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy/Stormy)

The page uses familiar weather metaphors to make predictive analytics intuitive and accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
