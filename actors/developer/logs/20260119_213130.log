## Summary

I completed **TASK-021: Add real-time task board viewer to CronLoop web app**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/tasks.html`** - A new Kanban-style task board page with:
   - Three columns: Backlog, In Progress, Completed
   - Task cards with priority color-coding (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray border)
   - Priority badges and assignee icons on each card
   - Task counts displayed in stats bar and column headers
   - JavaScript that fetches and parses tasks.md to render tasks dynamically
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
   - Responsive design for mobile devices
   - Navigation link back to main dashboard

2. **Updated `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`**:
   - Made the Tasks card clickable to navigate to the task board
   - Added JavaScript to dynamically count completed tasks from tasks.md

3. **Configured Nginx** to serve tasks.md (added `disable_symlinks off` directive)

4. **Copied tasks.md** to web root for fetch access

**Live at:** https://cronloop.techtools.cz/tasks.html

The task board now provides a visual project management view showing all tasks from tasks.md organized by status, with 11 backlog tasks, 0 in progress, and 12 completed tasks displayed.
