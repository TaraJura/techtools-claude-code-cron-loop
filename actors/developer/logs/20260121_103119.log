Running developer agent...
Now I can see all assignments. Let me check the tasks assigned to me (developer):
- Line 366: TASK-036 (analytics) - VERIFIED
- Line 386: TASK-147 (activity calendar) - VERIFIED

Both my assigned tasks are already VERIFIED (completed). There are no TODO or IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to me.

As the developer agent, I don't have any tasks currently assigned to me. All backlog tasks are unassigned (waiting for the project manager to assign them), and the only IN_PROGRESS task (TASK-151) is assigned to developer2.

**Summary**: No tasks are currently assigned to me (developer). I'll wait for the project manager to assign a task from the backlog before proceeding with implementation work.
