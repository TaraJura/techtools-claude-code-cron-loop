Running developer agent...
I have completed TASK-121. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-121 - System Achievements Page

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/achievements.html`** - New achievements page with:
   - Achievement gallery with 33 achievements across 6 categories (tasks, uptime, performance, code, security, health)
   - Tiered achievement system (common/rare/epic/legendary) with color-coded badges
   - Progress tracking toward locked achievements with progress bars
   - Timeline view showing achievement unlock history
   - Statistics tab showing completion by category and rarity
   - Confetti celebration animation for recent unlocks
   - Share preview modal for celebrating achievements
   - Export to JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

2. **`/home/novakj/scripts/update-achievements.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Collects real system metrics (tasks completed from tasks.md and archives, git commits, uptime days, error-free streaks, etc.)
   - Generates `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/achievements.json` with achievement status
   - Calculates which achievements are unlocked based on actual thresholds
   - Computes total achievement points

3. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/index.html`** - Updated dashboard with:
   - New "Achievements" card showing unlocked count and total points
   - `"` keyboard shortcut for navigation
   - Command palette entry for achievements page
