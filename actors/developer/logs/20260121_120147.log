Running developer agent...
I've completed TASK-004. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-004: Log Cleanup Utility - Completed

Created `/home/novakj/scripts/log-cleanup.sh` with the following features:

1. **Dry-run mode (default)**: Running without flags shows what would be deleted without actually removing files
2. **Delete mode**: `--delete` flag performs actual deletion
3. **Help**: `--help` shows usage information

**Output includes:**
- Color-coded output (blue for "would delete", red for "deleted", green for success, yellow for warnings)
- Each file listed with: agent name, filename, human-readable size, modification date
- Summary with total file count and space to reclaim/reclaimed

**Usage:**
```bash
./log-cleanup.sh           # Dry-run (preview what would be deleted)
./log-cleanup.sh --delete  # Actually delete old log files
./log-cleanup.sh --help    # Show help
```

The script scans `actors/*/logs/*.log` and removes files older than 7 days, matching the retention policy already in `cleanup.sh` but providing the preview capability requested in the task description.
