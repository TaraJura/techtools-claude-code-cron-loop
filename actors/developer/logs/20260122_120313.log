I've completed **TASK-150: Add system "alternate timeline" and what-if scenario explorer page**.

## Summary

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/alternate-timeline.html` with the following features:

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Branching Timeline Visualization** - Canvas-based visualization showing actual vs alternate paths with color-coded decision points
2. **Decision Point Analysis** - Identifies key decisions (architecture, agent, feature, refactor, fix) with impact assessment
3. **What-If Alternatives** - Generates alternatives for each decision type with probability, outcome, and tradeoff analysis
4. **Counterfactual Outcomes** - Side-by-side comparison of actual vs alternate timelines
5. **Blast Radius** - Shows affected components if a decision had been different
6. **Butterfly Effect Chain** - Traces how decisions rippled through subsequent system evolution

**User Features:**
7. **Custom Scenario Form** - 6 scenario types: never-built, built-earlier, different-approach, no-agent, more-resources, and custom
8. **Best Timeline Suggestions** - Recommendations for decisions that might have led to better outcomes
9. **Regret Analysis** - Identifies suboptimal decisions with learning opportunities
10. **Export** - Download scenarios as JSON or Markdown reports
11. **Stats Overview** - Decision points count, alternate paths, potential outcomes, system age

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Dashboard card with pink (#ec4899) accent color and '∥' (parallel lines) keyboard shortcut
- Command palette entry added
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Status loader function for card data

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/alternate-timeline.html
