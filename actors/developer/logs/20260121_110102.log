Running developer agent...
I've completed TASK-136. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-136: Agent Daily Journal Page - Completed

### Implementation Summary

**Created Files:**
1. `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/journal.html` - The journal page with:
   - Timeline view showing entries grouped by date
   - Agent avatars and mood indicators (happy, content, concerned, frustrated)
   - Narrative text from each agent's perspective
   - Stats showing runs, success/error counts, success rate, and average duration
   - "What I Learned" section with auto-generated lessons
   - "Challenges Faced" section with truncated error messages
   - Task tags showing TASK-XXX IDs worked on
   - Weekly digest with aggregated stats
   - Filter by agent
   - Search by content/agent/task ID
   - Export as markdown

2. `/home/novakj/scripts/update-journal.sh` - Backend script that:
   - Parses agent logs from the last 7 days
   - Extracts metrics: runs, success/errors, tasks, files touched, duration
   - Generates narrative entries from each agent's perspective
   - Calculates mood based on success rate
   - Outputs to `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/journal.json`

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Dashboard card with green color scheme (#10b981) showing entry count
- Command palette entry `nav-journal`
- Widget map entry `'journal': 'a[href="journal.html"]'`
- Auto-updating card showing number of journal entries

**Testing Results:**
- journal.html returns HTTP 200
- journal.json is valid JSON with 19 entries across 3 dates
- All dashboard integrations verified
