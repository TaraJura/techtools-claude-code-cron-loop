I have completed **TASK-160: Add personalized "What's New" changelog popup and returning user catch-up feature**.

## Summary of Implementation

### Files Created:
1. **`/home/novakj/scripts/generate-whatsnew.sh`** - Backend script that:
   - Parses changelog.md for recent entries (features, bug fixes, security events, improvements)
   - Parses tasks.md for completed tasks
   - Gets recent git commits
   - Detects new/modified HTML pages
   - Generates `/api/whatsnew.json` with summary, changes, metrics, and highlights
   - Maintains `/api/whatsnew-history.json` with 30-day retention

2. **`/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/whatsnew.html`** - Full page with:
   - User welcome banner showing time since last visit
   - Stats grid (total changes, features, tasks, security, bug fixes, improvements)
   - Top highlights section
   - Category filter buttons
   - Timeline view grouped by date with NEW badges for unseen items
   - Mark All Seen functionality
   - Share button
   - 5-minute auto-refresh

### Changes to index.html:
1. **Dashboard card** - New "What's New" card with:
   - Purple accent color
   - Shows total change count
   - Badge shows unseen count (red dot with number)
   - Keyboard hint 'n' (note: 'W' was already taken by workflow.html)

2. **Popup modal** - Auto-shows after 6+ hours away:
   - Stats overview
   - Scrollable list of recent changes (top 10)
   - Mark All Seen button
   - Link to full /whatsnew.html page

3. **Command palette entry** - Navigate with shortcut 'n'

4. **widgetMap entry** - For dashboard layout customization

### Key Features:
- Tracks last visit time in localStorage
- Tracks last seen timestamp separately (to show NEW badges)
- Auto-popup after 6+ hours away with unseen changes
- Keyboard shortcut 'n' to open popup anytime
- Changes are categorized: feature, task, security, bugfix, improvement, commit, page
