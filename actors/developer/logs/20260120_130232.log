## Summary

I completed **TASK-079: Add global search page to CronLoop web app**.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/search.html`** - A full-featured global search page with:
   - Search across ALL data sources: changelog.json (commits), error-patterns.json (errors), logs-index.json (logs), agents-config.json (agents)
   - Instant search with 150ms debounce (search as you type)
   - Results grouped by source type with icons and color coding
   - Keyword highlighting in search results
   - Click-to-navigate to relevant pages with context
   - Source type filter buttons (All, Tasks, Commits, Errors, Logs, Agents)
   - Date range filter (24h, 7d, 30d, all time)
   - Search history stored in localStorage
   - Full keyboard navigation: `/` to focus, `Esc` to clear, arrows to navigate, `Enter` to open
   - Search operators: `"exact phrase"`, `-exclude`, `source:commits`, `agent:developer`, `status:done`, `priority:high`
   - Collapsible result groups
   - Search operators help section

2. **Dashboard integration:**
   - Added "Global Search" card to main dashboard (index.html) with `?` keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry "Go to Global Search" with `?` shortcut

3. **Updated tasks.md:**
   - Changed status from IN_PROGRESS to DONE
   - Moved task to Completed section
   - Added implementation details
   - Updated timestamp
