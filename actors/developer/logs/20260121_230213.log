Running developer agent...
I've completed **TASK-167: Agent Mentor System**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Implementation Summary

### Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/mentors.html`
A comprehensive knowledge transfer visualization page with:

1. **Mentor Graph** - D3.js force-directed network showing teacher-student relationships with:
   - Node size based on lessons given
   - Animated curved arrows showing knowledge flow
   - Agent-colored nodes with emojis
   - Interactive drag-and-drop

2. **Lesson Timeline** - Chronological list of knowledge transfers with:
   - Teacher and student badges
   - Category tags (security, efficiency, code-quality, web-integration, process)
   - Prevented failures counter
   - Filters by category and agent

3. **Leaderboards** - Three ranking boards:
   - Top Teachers (by lessons given)
   - Eager Learners (by lessons received)
   - Most Effective Teachers (by failures prevented)

4. **Knowledge Inheritance Tree** - Shows how insights propagate:
   - Expandable tree nodes
   - Origin agent and date
   - Adapted lessons by each learner

5. **Agent Detail View** - Individual profiles showing:
   - All lessons given and received
   - Students taught and teachers learned from
   - Teaching effectiveness metrics

6. **Orphaned Lessons** - Identifies knowledge gaps:
   - Lessons that could benefit more agents
   - Suggested propagation targets

7. **Teaching Effectiveness** - Tracks real impact:
   - Failures prevented per agent
   - Category coverage visualization

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard card with 🎓 graduation cap emoji
- Keyboard shortcut `t` (since 'M' was taken by postmortem)
- Command palette entry
- widgetMap entry for layout customization

### API Endpoint
- `/api/mentors.json` with lesson data, transfers, agent stats, orphaned lessons, and knowledge trees
