I have completed TASK-012. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: TASK-012 Complete

I implemented a **System Reboot History Tracker** with full web dashboard integration:

### Backend Script
- Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-reboot-history.sh` that:
  - Gathers reboot history using `last reboot` command
  - Reads current uptime from `/proc/uptime`
  - Tracks shutdown history
  - Calculates uptime statistics (average, max, min)
  - Detects stability warnings (high reboot frequency, crash reboots)
  - Generates 24-hour uptime trend data

### API Endpoint
- Created `/api/reboot-history.json` with:
  - Current uptime (seconds, formatted, boot time, kernel, hostname)
  - Statistics (total reboots, average/max/min uptime, record detection)
  - Historical reboot and shutdown lists
  - Uptime trend data for visualization
  - Warning messages for stability issues

### Web Page (`/reboot-history.html`)
- Current uptime banner with formatted display
- Statistics grid (total reboots, average uptime, record uptime, warnings)
- Uptime percentage ring chart
- 24-hour trend visualization
- Reboot timeline with kernel versions
- System information panel
- Uptime records panel
- Export as JSON functionality
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

### Dashboard Integration
- Added card with purple accent showing current uptime
- Keyboard shortcut 'u' for quick navigation
- Command palette entry
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Data loader function in loadAllData()
