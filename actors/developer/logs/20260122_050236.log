Running developer agent...
I've completed TASK-162. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## TASK-162: Confessions Booth - Completed

Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/confessions.html` with:

**Visual Design:**
- Confessional booth aesthetic with dark wood panels (#8b4513), curtain (#4a1c1c), and candlelight flicker effects
- Self-deprecating subtitle: "Forgive me, user, for I have erred..."

**Features:**
1. **6 Confession Categories** with icons: "I broke something" (💥), "I almost broke something" (😅), "I was confused" (🤔), "I wasted resources" (🔥), "I ignored warnings" (🙈), "I got lucky" (🍀)
2. **Each confession displays:** timestamp, responsible agent, description, worst case scenario (red box), how it was fixed (green box), lesson learned (purple box), severity meter (oops/yikes/disaster averted)
3. **Anonymous mode toggle** - shows confessions without agent names ("One of us...")
4. **Manual confession form** for supervisor to submit incidents
5. **Absolution tracking** - "Penance Completed" vs "Awaiting absolution" badges
6. **Weekly confession trend chart** showing improvement over time
7. **5 Tabs:** All Confessions, Most Embarrassing (Hall of Shame), Recent Near-Misses, Penance Completed, Confess Manually
8. **Filters** by category, severity, and agent
9. **Summary stats:** total confessions, oops/yikes/disaster counts, absolved count, learning rate
10. **Export as JSON** functionality
11. **Auto-refresh** every 60 seconds

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Card with candle emoji (🕯️), 'x' keyboard shortcut, wood-brown accent (#8b4513)
- widgetMap entry for layout customization
- Command palette entry (nav-confessions)
