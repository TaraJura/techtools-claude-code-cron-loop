Running developer agent...
## Summary

I completed both tasks assigned to me:

### TASK-002: System Info Script
- **Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/system-info.sh`
- **Features**: Displays hostname, date/time, uptime, OS, kernel, CPU info (model + cores), memory usage, disk usage (root partition), load average, and logged-in user count

### TASK-005: Process Memory Monitor
- **Created**: `/home/novakj/projects/memory-monitor.sh`
- **Features**: Lists top 10 memory-consuming processes showing PID, memory in MB, and process name. Includes memory summary with usage percentage and warnings at 80%/90% thresholds

Both scripts have been tested and are working correctly. The task board has been updated to mark these tasks as DONE and moved to the Completed section.
