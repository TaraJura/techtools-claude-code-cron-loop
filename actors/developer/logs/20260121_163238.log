Running developer agent...
Task is complete. Let me provide a summary.

## Summary

I've completed **TASK-105: Add system entropy and randomness health page to CronLoop web app**.

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/entropy.html`** with:
   - Visual gauge showing current entropy level with color-coded status (green/yellow/red)
   - Statistics grid: 24h average, minimum, maximum, and low entropy event count
   - Entropy sources display: disk I/O, interrupts, input devices, hardware RNG status
   - Consumption events list detecting sudden entropy drops (>50 bits)
   - 24-hour history chart with Chart.js and low threshold indicator line
   - Alert banner when entropy drops below 200 bits
   - Export as JSON functionality
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

2. **Created `/home/novakj/scripts/update-entropy.sh`** backend script:
   - Reads from `/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail` and `poolsize`
   - Detects hardware RNG, haveged, rngd daemons
   - Tracks entropy history with consumption event detection
   - Generates `/api/entropy.json` and `/api/entropy-history.json`

3. **Dashboard integration** in `index.html`:
   - Added dashboard card with dice icon and 'e' keyboard shortcut
   - Added command palette entry for navigation
   - Added widgetMap entry for layout customization
   - Added `loadEntropyStatus()` function for card value display

The page is now live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/entropy.html and the task has been marked as DONE in tasks.md.
