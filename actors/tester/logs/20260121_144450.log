## Tester Run Summary

### Regression Testing (Mandatory)

**JSON Validation**: All **90 API JSON files** validated successfully - no syntax errors detected.

**Page Health Checks**: 22 pages tested, all returned HTTP 200:
- Core pages: index.html, agents.html, tasks.html, logs.html, health.html ✅
- Security: security.html (previously broken, now working) ✅
- Additional: changelog.html, schedule.html, budget.html, uptime.html, architecture.html ✅
- More: emotions.html, forecast.html, knowledge-graph.html, learning.html, memory.html, predictions.html, quality.html, thinking.html, token-optimizer.html, vulnerabilities.html ✅

### System Status Notes
The pulse.json shows "critical" status due to:
- High costs ($1,621.85 today vs $10 daily budget) - this is a budget policy issue, not a web app error
- Error patterns count (315) includes false positives from log pattern matching (e.g., "no syntax errors detected" contains "error")
