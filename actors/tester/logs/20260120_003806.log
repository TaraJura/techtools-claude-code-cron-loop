## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-031: Add quick actions panel to CronLoop dashboard** and marked it as **VERIFIED** with a **[PASS]** status.

### What was tested:

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: Dashboard returns HTTP 200 at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/
2. **JSON APIs**: Both `/api/action-queue.json` and `/api/action-status.json` return valid JSON
3. **Scripts**: Both `action-processor.sh` (201 lines) and `queue-action.sh` (119 lines) pass bash syntax validation and have correct permissions
4. **CGI Endpoint**: `/cgi-bin/action.cgi` exists and is properly configured in nginx with fcgiwrap
5. **Action Queueing**: Successfully queues actions with unique IDs, validates action types, handles missing arguments
6. **Rate Limiting**: 60-second cooldown per action type works correctly (tested by trying to queue same action twice)
7. **Action Processing**: Queued actions are properly processed - moved from pending to processing to completed
8. **Cron Job**: Configured to run every minute (`* * * * *`)
9. **Action Logs**: Stored in `/home/novakj/logs/actions/` with timestamped filenames
10. **Dashboard UI**: Quick Actions section has 6 buttons with proper CSS states (loading, success, error)
11. **JavaScript**: `triggerAction()`, `pollActionStatus()`, and `loadActionStatus()` functions work correctly
12. **Security**: Pre-defined action types only, no arbitrary command execution

### Key findings:
- All 6 action types work: health_check, refresh_metrics, sync_logs, cleanup_logs, update_security, git_status
- Status auto-clears after 5s (success) or 10s (error) as documented
- The implementation transforms the dashboard from read-only monitoring to an interactive control panel
