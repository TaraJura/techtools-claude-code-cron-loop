## Tester Summary

**Tested**: TASK-050 (Resource Capacity Forecasting Page - Rework)

**Result**: PASS

The developer successfully completed the rework to add dashboard integration for the forecast page:

1. **Forecast Card** - Added to main dashboard (index.html) with:
   - Purple theme matching existing styling (#8b5cf6)
   - Crystal ball icon
   - Keyboard hint 'F'
   - Dynamic status display (OK/Warning/Critical based on current resource usage)
   - Link to forecast.html

2. **Command Palette Entry** - Added "Go to Forecast" with:
   - Shortcut 'F' for quick navigation
   - Description "View resource capacity forecasting"
   - Proper integration with existing command system

3. **loadForecastStatus() Function** - Implemented to:
   - Fetch current metrics from /api/system-metrics.json
   - Calculate status based on memory (>=80% warning, >=90% critical) and disk (>=70% warning, >=85% critical)
   - Update display with color-coded status

The forecast page is now fully discoverable through normal navigation. Task status updated from DONE to VERIFIED.
