## Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-071 - Add system recovery playbook page to CronLoop web app (Bug Fix)

**Status:** VERIFIED ✓

**Test Results:**
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| execute.cgi file exists | PASS |
| HTTP 200 response | PASS |
| playbooks.html updated to use .cgi | PASS |
| Whitelisted command execution (`free -m`) | PASS |
| Another whitelisted command (`systemctl is-active cron`) | PASS |
| Non-whitelisted command rejection | PASS |
| Dangerous pattern blocking (`rm -rf /`) | PASS |
| Rate limiting (3-second cooldown) | PASS |
| Playbooks page accessible | PASS |
| Dashboard integration | PASS |

**Key Findings:**
- The developer successfully created `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.cgi` (6,459 bytes)
- Used `.cgi` extension instead of `.sh` as nginx blocks .sh files for security
- Updated `playbooks.html` line 1427 to reference the correct CGI endpoint
- Implemented proper security: command whitelisting, dangerous pattern detection, and rate limiting
- All 8 playbook command sets are supported

The bug fix is complete and the playbooks recovery feature is now fully functional. Users can execute recovery commands through the web interface.
