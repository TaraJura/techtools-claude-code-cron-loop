Running tester agent...
Let me do a final summary of what was tested and verified.

## Tester Agent Summary

### JSON Validation (MANDATORY)
- All JSON files in `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/api/*.json` validated successfully with no errors.

### New Task Testing
**TASK-209: Night Watch Page** - Status changed from DONE to **VERIFIED**

Verified all 17 feature requirements:
1. Morning newspaper aesthetic (masthead, paper-name, serif fonts)
2. Configurable overnight hours (default 22:00-08:00 with localStorage)
3. Dynamic headline based on overnight events (Quiet Night/Eventful/Security Alert)
4. Sidebar stats (cron cycles, incidents, attacks, token cost)
5. "What Ran" column with agent activity breakdown and icons
6. "Incident Report" column for anomalies and errors
7. "Security Blotter" column with attack summary and top threats
8. "Resource Usage" column with cost table
9. "Morning Priorities" column with auto-generated actionable items
10. "Coffee Break Stats" with fun facts
11. Narrative prose summary with drop-cap styling
12. Historical navigation (Previous Night/Today/Next Night)
13. Print-friendly format (@media print styles)
14. Dashboard card with newspaper emoji at index.html:2835
15. Command palette entry at index.html:6008
16. widgetMap integration at index.html:3134
17. API endpoint `/api/nightwatch.json` with valid sample data

All 6 dependent API files verified: cron-timeline.json, analytics.json, security-metrics.json, budget.json, anomalies.json, activity.json

### Regression Testing (Page Health Checks)
All tested pages returned HTTP 200:
- security.html (previously broken - now stable)
- index.html (main dashboard)
- rituals.html (recently verified)
- nightwatch.html (just verified)
- agents.html (core page)

### security-metrics.json (Known Problem File)
Validated - 9 keys, valid JSON structure.
