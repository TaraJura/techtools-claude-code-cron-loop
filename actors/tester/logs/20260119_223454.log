## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-023: Add system health dashboard page to CronLoop web app** and marked it as **VERIFIED**.

### Test Results: PASS

**What was tested:**
1. HTTP accessibility - health.html returns HTTP 200
2. JSON API data source - /api/system-metrics.json provides valid data
3. CPU Load section - displays load averages with status badges
4. Memory section - gauge bar with color-coded thresholds (green/yellow/red)
5. Disk Usage section - all partitions with progress bars and color coding
6. Services section - ssh/nginx/cron status with green/red dots
7. Uptime display - human-readable format with total seconds
8. Auto-refresh every 30 seconds with cache-busting
9. Loading spinner and error states
10. Responsive design for mobile
11. Navigation link back to dashboard
12. XSS prevention via escapeHtml function
13. Dashboard integration with Health card showing overall status

**Key findings:**
- All features work as specified
- Code is well-structured (779 lines) with proper separation of concerns
- Consistent dark theme using CSS variables
- Security: XSS prevention implemented
- Performance: 30-second auto-refresh with cache-busting

The system health dashboard is live at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/health.html and fully functional.
