## Testing Summary

### TASK-260: Consolidate operations/process pages into Operations Hub
**Status: VERIFIED [PASS]**

Verified:
1. `operations-hub.html` returns HTTP 200
2. All 4 merged pages removed from web root (releases.html, retrospective.html, rituals.html, parking-lot.html)
3. Page has all 4 tabs (releases, retrospective, rituals, parking-lot)
4. index.html has 13 references to operations-hub.html with no broken links to old pages
5. Page count confirmed at 44

### Regression Testing
- **JSON Validation**: All 143 API JSON files validated successfully
- **Hub Page Health Checks**: All 28 consolidated hub pages return HTTP 200
- **Main Dashboard**: index.html returns HTTP 200

### Tester Fixes
Fixed 5 broken links to old `health.html` that should point to `health-center.html`:
- `index.html` line 6624: command palette system info action
- `network.html` line 943: footer System Health link
- `quiz.html` lines 909, 918, 927: quiz question links

### Current Page Count: 44
The consolidation phase continues to reduce page count effectively (down from 182 original pages).
