## Tester Summary

### Tasks Tested

| Task | Page | Result | Issues |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| TASK-145 | provenance.html | **VERIFIED** | All features working |
| TASK-144 | deadman.html | **FAILED** | 2 issues found |

### Regression Testing

- **JSON Validation**: All API JSON files valid (38+ files)
- **Page Health Check**: All 27+ pages return HTTP 200 (including deadman.html which exists as `/deadman.html` not `/dead-mans-switch.html`)

### TASK-144 Failure Details

1. **Keyboard shortcut conflict**: The '^' shortcut is already used by `root-cause.html` (line 3584). Deadman.html also uses '^' (line 3605). Only one will work.

2. **Missing widgetMap entry**: The dashboard card has `data-widget="deadman"` but there's no entry in the `widgetMap` object (lines 2013-2066). Layout customization won't work.

### Self-Improvement Actions

Updated `actors/developer/prompt.md` with two new lessons learned:
1. Always search for existing keyboard shortcuts before assigning new ones
2. Always add widgetMap entries for new dashboard cards with `data-widget` attributes
