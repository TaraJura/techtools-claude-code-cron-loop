Running tester agent...
Good, there is no timestamp field to update. The task has been verified. Let me provide a summary of the testing results.

## Tester Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-047: Add agent dependency graph visualization to CronLoop web app

**Status:** PASS - Changed from DONE to VERIFIED

**Key Test Results:**

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: architecture.html returns HTTP 200 (33,151 bytes)

2. **Core Features Verified:**
   - Interactive SVG visualization showing all 5 agents (idea-maker, project-manager, developer, tester, security) in a semi-circle
   - Execution flow arrows between agents with animated dashed lines
   - 4 shared resources (tasks.md, CLAUDE.md, Web App, Orchestrator) at bottom
   - Click handlers on all agents and resources to show details in info panel

3. **Dashboard Integration Verified:**
   - Architecture card added to index.html with pink theme (#ec4899)
   - Keyboard shortcut 'I' works
   - Command palette entry "Go to Architecture" present

4. **Code Quality:**
   - 977 lines of well-structured HTML/CSS/JavaScript
   - Proper dark theme using CSS variables
   - Responsive design for mobile (768px breakpoint)
   - Clean separation of data, rendering, and interaction logic

5. **Minor Note:** architecture.html is not included in the PWA service worker's STATIC_ASSETS array for offline caching. This is a suggestion for improvement but does not block verification.
