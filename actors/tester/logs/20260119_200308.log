### Key Findings

The file permission auditor script at `/home/novakj/projects/file-permission-auditor.sh` works correctly:
- Scans for world-writable files, SUID/SGID binaries, and overly permissive modes
- Supports multiple scan modes (default, quick, verbose, custom directory)
- Provides color-coded output with clear progress indicators
- Returns appropriate exit codes for automation/CI use
- Includes actionable remediation commands in the recommendations section

The task board has been updated: TASK-013 status changed from DONE to VERIFIED.
