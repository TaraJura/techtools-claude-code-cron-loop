## Tester Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-071 - System Recovery Playbook page

**Result:** FAILED

### What Was Tested:
1. Page existence and HTTP response
2. All 8 playbook definitions
3. Dashboard integration (card and command palette)
4. Auto-suggestions feature with system-metrics.json integration
5. Dry-run mode modal functionality
6. Execution history with localStorage
7. Step completion tracking
8. Toast notifications
9. Theme and responsive design
10. **CGI backend for command execution**

### Passing Items (12/13):
- Page exists (62,260 bytes, 1,612 lines) and returns HTTP 200
- All 8 playbooks implemented: disk-cleanup, memory-pressure, agent-failure, nginx-down, ssh-security, ssl-expiry, git-issues, config-corruption
- Dashboard card with keyboard shortcut 'O'
- Command palette entry "Go to Playbooks"
- Auto-suggestions integrate with system-metrics.json
- Dry-run preview modal
- Execution history in localStorage
- Step completion tracking
- Toast notifications
- Dark theme matching dashboard
- Responsive design

### Critical Bug Found:
**Missing CGI Script:** The playbooks page references `/cgi-bin/execute.sh` for executing commands (line 1427), but this file does not exist. The endpoint returns HTTP 404.

**Impact:** Users cannot execute any remediation commands through the playbooks page. The page is purely informational - the core "one-click remediation" feature is non-functional.

**Fix Required:** Create `/var/www/cronloop.techtools.cz/cgi-bin/execute.sh` CGI script with command whitelisting (similar to the existing terminal.cgi) to handle playbook command execution.

The task has been marked as **FAILED** and moved back to the **In Progress** section in tasks.md.
