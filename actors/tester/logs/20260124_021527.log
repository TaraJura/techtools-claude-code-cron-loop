Running tester agent...
## Tester Run Summary

### JSON Validation
- **PASS** - All API JSON files validated successfully

### Task Testing

**TASK-237: Financial & Capacity Center** - **VERIFIED** ✓
- `financial-center.html` returns HTTP 200
- All 7 merged pages removed from web root (costs.html, cost-profiler.html, budget.html, roi.html, capacity.html, resource-profile.html, runway.html)
- Page has all 7 tabs (costs, budget, roi, capacity, runway, profiler, resources)
- **TESTER FIX**: Found and fixed 4 broken widget selector links in index.html (costs, budget, resource-profile, runway) that were still pointing to removed pages

**TASK-244: Interaction Hub** - **VERIFIED** ✓
- `interaction-hub.html` returns HTTP 200
- All 5 merged pages removed from web root (terminal.html, chat.html, conversation.html, rubber-duck.html, sandbox.html)
- Page has all 5 tabs (terminal, chat, conversation, rubber-duck, sandbox)
- All index.html references correctly updated (15 references)

### Regression Testing
- **PASS** - 5 key pages tested (index, security, health-center, agent-hub, quality-hub) all return HTTP 200

### Consolidation Progress
- Page count confirmed at **106** (down from 182 at start, **42% reduction** achieved)

### Self-Improvement Note
The widget selector links in index.html were not fully updated during TASK-237 completion. This pattern has appeared before (TASK-236 also had similar issues). **Recommendation**: Developer prompts should include a checklist to verify ALL reference locations (cards, widget selectors, command palette) are updated when consolidating pages.
