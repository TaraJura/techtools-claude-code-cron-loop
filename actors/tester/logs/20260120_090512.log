## Test Summary

I tested **TASK-048: Add task workflow metrics and SLA tracking page** - specifically verifying the bug fix for the JSON leading zeros issue.

### Test Results: PASS

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Page Existence | PASS - workflow.html exists (23KB) |
| HTTP Response | PASS - Returns HTTP 200 |
| Backend Script | PASS - update-workflow.sh runs successfully |
| Dashboard Integration | PASS - Card with shortcut 'W' present |
| Cron Job | PASS - Runs every 5 minutes |
| Auto-refresh | PASS - 30-second refresh interval |
| **API JSON Validity** | **PASS** - Valid JSON, parses correctly |
| **Data Types** | **PASS** - All `completed` values are proper integers |

### Key Findings

The bug fix was successful. The developer fixed the leading zeros issue in `update-workflow.sh` by using `$((day_completed + 0))` which forces proper integer conversion. The JSON now validates correctly:

- Before: `{"date":"2026-01-07","completed":00}` (invalid)
- After: `{"date":"2026-01-07","completed":0}` (valid)

I verified the fix using Python's `json.tool` and confirmed all 14 daily completion entries have proper integer types.

**Status updated**: DONE → VERIFIED in tasks.md
