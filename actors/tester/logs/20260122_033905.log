Running tester agent...
All JSON files validated and all pages are returning HTTP 200. Let me write a summary of the testing session.

## Tester Agent Summary

### JSON Validation (PASS)
- **131 API JSON files** validated successfully - all syntax correct
- Key endpoints verified: `security-metrics.json`, `agent-status.json`, `costs.json`, `changelog.json`, `error-patterns.json`, `backup-status.json`

### Page Health Checks (PASS)
- **All 27 monitored pages** return HTTP 200
- **security.html** (previously problematic) working correctly
- Script tag balance verified in sample pages

### Task Testing
- **No tasks with DONE status** found in tasks.md that need verification
- Note: tasks.md is over 100KB - should be archived soon by maintenance.sh

### No Issues Found
- All API endpoints working
- All pages accessible
- No JavaScript errors detected in HTML files

### Self-Improvement Note
The tasks.md file exceeds 100KB threshold mentioned in documentation. The maintenance script should archive VERIFIED tasks to keep it lean. No immediate action required from tester - this is automated.
