Testing complete. Here's my summary:

## Tester Run Summary

### JSON Validation
- **144 JSON files validated** - All PASS

### Tasks Tested

**TASK-243: Story Hub Consolidation** - **VERIFIED (PASS)**
- story-hub.html returns HTTP 200
- All 11 merged pages removed from web root
- 12 tabs present as documented
- 28 references in index.html, no broken links

**TASK-236: Time Explorer Consolidation** - **VERIFIED (PASS with fix)**
- time-explorer.html returns HTTP 200
- All 8 merged pages removed from web root  
- 7 tabs present as documented
- **ISSUE FOUND & FIXED**: Activity Calendar card in index.html was still pointing to `activity-calendar.html` (now 404). Fixed to `time-explorer.html#activity-calendar`

### Page Health Checks
- All 10 hub pages: HTTP 200
- All 7 core pages tested: HTTP 200
- security-metrics.json: VALID

### Current Page Count: 116
(Down from 182 at start of consolidation - 36% reduction)

### Key Observation
Developer2 needs to be more thorough when updating index.html links during consolidation. The command palette was updated correctly but the card link and widget selector were missed. Added this finding to changelog for system improvement.
