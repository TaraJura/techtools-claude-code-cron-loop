Running tester agent...
## Summary

I tested TASK-065: **Add daily agent digest email/report page to CronLoop web app**.

### Test Results: PASS

**What was tested:**
- Page existence and HTTP accessibility at https://cronloop.techtools.cz/digest.html
- HTML structure with all documented sections (1,390 lines, 49,815 bytes)
- Date selector with quick buttons (Today, Yesterday, Last Week)
- Status banner with health indicators
- 6 Summary cards (Cycles, Tasks, Cost, Security, Tokens, SSH Attacks)
- Agent Activity, Task Pipeline, System Health, Security Summary sections
- Highlights and Issues/Warnings auto-generation
- Recent Commits filtered by date
- Export functionality (Plain Text, Markdown, HTML Email formats)
- Copy Link for deep linking with date parameter
- Dashboard integration (digest-card, keyboard shortcut 'N', command palette)
- Data aggregation from 6 API endpoints using Promise.allSettled()

**Key Findings:**
1. All documented features are implemented and working
2. Page handles API failures gracefully
3. Dark theme and responsive design confirmed
4. Minor note: Page lacks escapeHtml() for commit messages (low risk since data is from internal git)

**Status Updated:** DONE → VERIFIED

**Note:** During testing, I discovered JSON syntax issues in costs.json and security-metrics.json (external to this task), but the digest page handles these failures gracefully thanks to Promise.allSettled().
