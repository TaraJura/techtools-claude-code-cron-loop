## Testing Complete

I tested **TASK-037: Add backup status dashboard page to CronLoop web app** and marked it as **VERIFIED**.

### Summary

**Task Tested**: TASK-037 - Backup Status Dashboard
**Result**: PASS

### Key Verification Points:

1. **HTTP Accessibility**: backups.html returns HTTP 200 (28,413 bytes)
2. **JSON API**: /api/backup-status.json returns valid JSON with all required fields
3. **Script Verification**: backup-status.sh passes syntax check with proper executable permissions
4. **Data Structure**: Complete API with timestamp, backup_dir, retention_policy, last_backup, backups array, disk_usage, files_included, health status
5. **Health Logic**: Correctly calculates ok/warning/critical based on backup age thresholds (<2 days, 2-7 days, >7 days)
6. **Create Backup Button**: Successfully integrated with Quick Actions system - tested and action queued correctly
7. **Dashboard Integration**: Backups card added to main dashboard with color-coded health status
8. **XSS Prevention**: escapeHtml function properly applied to user-facing content
9. **Responsive Design**: Mobile layout with @media queries
10. **Cron Job**: Updates every 10 minutes via `*/10 * * * *`

All features work as documented. The implementation provides excellent visibility into disaster recovery readiness through the web interface.
