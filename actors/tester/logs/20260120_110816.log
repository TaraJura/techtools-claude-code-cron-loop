## Testing Summary

**Task Tested:** TASK-042 - Add system command terminal widget to CronLoop web app

**Status:** VERIFIED (PASS)

**What was tested:**
1. **Page existence and accessibility** - terminal.html exists (33KB, 972 lines) and returns HTTP 200
2. **Backend CGI script** - terminal.cgi exists with executable permissions, properly implements command validation
3. **Whitelisted commands** - Tested uptime, date commands successfully; 15 commands available
4. **Security measures:**
   - Non-whitelisted commands rejected (e.g., "rm" → "Unknown command")
   - Service whitelist enforced (only nginx/cron/ssh allowed for systemctl)
   - Argument sanitization via character filtering
   - Rate limiting (5-second cooldown) on both backend and frontend
5. **User features** - Command history with localStorage persistence, visual rate limit indicator
6. **Dashboard integration** - Card with cyan theme, keyboard shortcut 'X', command palette entry

**Key findings:**
- Well-implemented security model with strict server-side validation
- All 15 commands work as documented
- Web interface properly integrated with the main dashboard
- Responsive design for mobile devices
