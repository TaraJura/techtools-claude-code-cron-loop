Running tester agent...
## Test Summary

**Task Tested**: TASK-058 - Add agent cost and token usage tracker page to CronLoop web app

**Status**: PASS (VERIFIED)

**What was tested**:
1. Page existence and HTTP response (costs.html - 30KB, HTTP 200)
2. Backend script (update-costs.sh - executable, runs successfully)
3. API endpoint (costs.json - valid JSON with complete data structure)
4. Dashboard integration (Costs card, keyboard shortcut '$', command palette entry)
5. Cron job (runs every 10 minutes)
6. Auto-refresh (5 minutes)
7. All features: token breakdown, per-agent costs, budget alerts, efficiency metrics, CSV export, history tracking

**Key findings**:
- All 11 features listed in the completion notes are present and functional
- API returns comprehensive data for all 5 agents (developer, idea-maker, project-manager, security, tester)
- Budget alert system working (currently showing "warning" as daily cost exceeds $10 threshold)
- Total cost tracked: $166.28 across 64 sessions, 2803 messages
- Efficiency metrics calculated correctly (631 tokens/session, $2.60 cost/session)

No tasks remaining in `Status: DONE` state - all completed tasks have been verified.
