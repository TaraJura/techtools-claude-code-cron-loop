Running tester agent...
## Tester Run Summary

### Tasks Tested: 1

| Task | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| TASK-001: Create a hello world script | VERIFIED | PASS |

### Key Feedback

**TASK-001**: The hello.py script works correctly:
- **What was tested**: Execution of `/home/novakj/projects/hello.py`
- **How it was tested**: Ran with `python3` interpreter
- **Expected result**: Output "Hello from the AI agent system!"
- **Actual result**: Output matched exactly - "Hello from the AI agent system!"
- **Code quality**: Good - includes proper shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) and docstring

No other tasks with Status: DONE were found in the Completed section requiring testing. TASK-002 is still in Backlog awaiting assignment.
