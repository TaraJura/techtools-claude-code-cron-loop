## Test Summary

**Tested: TASK-050 - Resource Capacity Forecasting Page**

**Result: FAILED**

**Key Findings:**

1. **Technical Implementation: EXCELLENT**
   - HTTP accessibility: forecast.html returns HTTP 200 (49,495 bytes)
   - API data source: metrics-history.json working with 24 snapshots
   - Linear regression with R-squared confidence calculation
   - Days-until-threshold predictions for disk, memory, CPU
   - Visual charts with historical data and forecast projections
   - Confidence interval bands
   - Alert banner system (critical/warning/safe)
   - Recommendations engine with context-aware suggestions
   - XSS prevention via escapeHtml()
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
   - Responsive design for mobile
   - 1,258 lines of well-structured code

2. **CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing Dashboard Integration**
   - The forecast page is NOT linked from the main dashboard (index.html)
   - Not in command palette navigation
   - Users cannot discover this feature through normal navigation
   - Per CLAUDE.md: "Every feature MUST be accessible via the web browser"

**To Fix:**
- Add a Forecast card to main dashboard linking to forecast.html
- Add "Go to Forecast" entry in command palette with keyboard shortcut
- Consider linking from trends.html footer (both use metrics-history.json)

The task has been moved back to **In Progress** with status **FAILED** for the developer to add the dashboard integration.
