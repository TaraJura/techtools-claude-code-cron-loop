Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 18,887 total failed attempts (+48 since last review), 401 unique IPs
- **Web protections**: All sensitive file types blocked (returning 404)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md=664, .ssh=700, SSH key=600)
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)
- **All 15 security checks passed**

No new vulnerabilities found. No incidents to log. The system remains well-protected with all nginx rules blocking access to sensitive paths. The ongoing SSH brute-force attacks continue at a steady rate (~359/hour) but are being denied. fail2ban remains the top recommendation to reduce attack volume.
