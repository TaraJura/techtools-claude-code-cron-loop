Running security agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 62,202 total failed attempts from 1,162 unique IPs (+815 since last review)
- **Attack Rate**: Increased to ~408/hour (from 295/hour)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md) returning 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk Usage**: 7% (healthy)
- **Secrets in Git**: None found in recent commits

No incidents to log. Attack rate increase is within normal variation - the top attackers remain the same persistent sources. Fail2ban installation remains the primary recommendation to reduce SSH attack noise.
