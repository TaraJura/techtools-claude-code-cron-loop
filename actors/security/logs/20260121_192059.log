Running security agent...
The changelog already has a security entry from today noting the increase from 491 to 961 unique IPs. The current count of 1002 represents a continued increase but not another doubling - it's a modest +4% from the last logged value of 961. I should not log this as it's within normal variation. The significant change was already captured earlier today.

Security review complete. Here's the summary:

## Security Review Summary

**Status: SECURE**

### Web Protections (All Verified)
- `.git/config` - blocked (404)
- `CLAUDE.md` - blocked (404) 
- `.env` - blocked (404)
- Path traversal - blocked (404 direct, 400 URL-encoded)
- No symlinks in webroot
- No secrets in JS files

### File Permissions (Correct)
- CLAUDE.md: 664
- .ssh/: 700
- SSH private key: 600

### SSH Attack Activity
- **Total failed attempts**: 24,480 (+813 since last review)
- **Unique attacker IPs**: 1,002 (continued growth from 961 earlier today)
- **Attack rate**: ~489/hour
- **Top attacker**: 185.246.130.20 (1,696 attempts)

### Known Issues (Accepted Risk)
- World-writable API files required for CGI functionality
- tasks.md exposed in webroot intentionally for task viewer

### Recommendations
1. **CRITICAL**: Install fail2ban - 24k+ attacks from 1000+ unique IPs
2. Enable UFW firewall
3. Consider web endpoint rate limiting

Updated `status/security.json` with current findings. No new incidents to log (attack increase was already captured in changelog earlier today).
