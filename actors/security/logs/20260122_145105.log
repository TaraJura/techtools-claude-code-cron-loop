Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 32,169 failed attempts from 802 unique IPs (~466/hour rate)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive paths blocked (returning 404)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **Disk Usage**: Healthy at 6%

No security incidents to report. All checks passed. The SSH brute-force attacks continue at a consistent rate - fail2ban installation remains the critical recommendation.
