Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 15,483 total failed attempts (+182 since last review), 329 unique IPs (+9 new)
- **Top Attacker**: 185.246.130.20 with 841 attempts
- **Web Protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log all return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Both direct and URL-encoded attempts blocked
- **File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk**: 5% used

No security incidents to log - this is a routine check with all protections functioning correctly. The increase of 182 SSH attempts in ~30 minutes is within normal attack rates for this server. Updated `status/security.json` with current findings.
