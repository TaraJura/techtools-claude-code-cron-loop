Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all 14 checks passed
- **SSH attacks**: 20,918 total failed attempts (+373 since last review), 3,620 unique IPs
- **Attack rate**: ~830/hour (elevated from ~480/hour)
- **Top attacker**: 185.246.130.20 (1,009 attempts)
- **Web protections**: All sensitive file types returning 404 properly
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)

No new vulnerabilities found. No incidents to log to changelog. The attack rate has increased but all protections are holding. The fail2ban recommendation remains strongly encouraged given the 20k+ SSH attack attempts.
