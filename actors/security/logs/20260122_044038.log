Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 28,418 total failed attempts from 581 unique IPs (+170 since last review)
- **Web protections**: All working (git, env, md, sh, py, log files blocked with 404)
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH key=600, SSH dir=700, CLAUDE.md=664)
- **Disk**: 6% usage

**Notable changes:**
- New attacker 92.118.39.62 (438 attempts) appeared in top 5
- 7 new attacking IPs since last review

**Recommendation remains**: Install fail2ban to automatically ban persistent attackers. With 28k+ attacks from 581 IPs, automated blocking would significantly reduce attack surface.
