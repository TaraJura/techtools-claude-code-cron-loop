Security review complete.

**Summary:**

All security checks passed:
- **Web protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md) return 404
- **Path traversal**: Both direct and URL-encoded attempts are blocked (404/400)
- **File permissions**: SSH key (600), SSH dir (700), CLAUDE.md (664) - all correct
- **No symlinks** in webroot, no git files exposed
- **No secrets** found in recent git commits
- **Disk usage**: Healthy at 6%

**SSH Attack Status:**
- 28,555 failed password attempts from 587 unique IPs
- Rate: ~428 attempts/hour
- Top attacker: 185.246.130.20 (2,131 attempts)
- Active attacker: 151.80.144.159 (1,633 attempts, currently probing)

**Standing Recommendations:**
1. Install fail2ban for SSH brute-force protection
2. Enable UFW firewall
3. Consider web rate limiting

No new incidents or vulnerabilities discovered. Status file updated.
