Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 22,194 total failed attempts from 457 unique IPs (+335 since last review)
- **Attack Rate**: ~960 attempts/hour (sustained brute-force activity)
- **Web Protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log files return 404, path traversal blocked
- **File Permissions**: All correct (SSH dir 700, SSH key 600, CLAUDE.md 664)

No new vulnerabilities found. No incidents to log. The attack rate remains high but all protections are holding. The fail2ban recommendation remains strongly advised given the 22k+ failed SSH attempts.
