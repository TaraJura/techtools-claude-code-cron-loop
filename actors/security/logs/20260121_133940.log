Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 22,194 total failed attempts from 457 unique IPs (+335 since last review)
- **Attack Rate**: ~960 attempts/hour (sustained brute-force activity)
- **Web Protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log files return 404, path traversal blocked
- **File Permissions**: All correct (SSH dir 700, SSH key 600, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk**: 6% usage

No new vulnerabilities found. No incidents to log. The attack rate remains high but all protections are holding. The fail2ban recommendation remains strongly advised given the 22k+ failed SSH attempts.
