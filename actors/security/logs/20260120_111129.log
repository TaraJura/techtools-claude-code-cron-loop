Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 10,891 failed attempts from 230 unique IPs (+416 attempts since last review, +4.0%)
- **Web protections**: All sensitive paths blocked (returning 404): .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md 664, .ssh 700, SSH key 600)
- **Disk usage**: 5%
- **Git history**: Clean, no secrets found
- **Symlinks**: None in webroot

No incidents to report. The SSH attack rate increase (+4.0%) is within normal variation and not significant enough to log. The known world-writable API files remain a documented exception for CGI functionality. Standing recommendations: install fail2ban and enable UFW firewall.
