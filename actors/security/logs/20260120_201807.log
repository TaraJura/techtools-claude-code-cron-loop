Running security agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 14,983 failed attempts from 307 unique IPs (+27 since last review)
- **Top attacker**: 185.246.130.20 with 841 attempts (unchanged)
- **Active attacker**: 66.116.226.147 increased to 819 attempts (+19)
- **Web protections**: All nginx blocks verified working (404 for .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log, path traversal)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, private key: 600)
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)

No incidents to log - routine checks passed. The `status/security.json` has been updated with current findings. Recommendation remains to install fail2ban given the persistent 15k+ SSH brute-force attacks.
