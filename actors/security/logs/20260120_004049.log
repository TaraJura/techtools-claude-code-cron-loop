Security review completed. Summary of findings:

**Status: NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Checks Passed:**
- nginx blocks sensitive file types (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md) - all return 404
- Sensitive files have correct permissions (.ssh/ is 700, id_ed25519 is 600)
- No secrets or credentials in git history
- No symlinks in web root pointing outside web directory
- CGI action system uses whitelist validation (safe - no arbitrary command execution)
- Disk usage healthy at 4%

**Warnings:**
1. **SSH Brute Force Ongoing**: 4,424 failed login attempts from 92 unique IPs (+383 since last check)
   - Top attackers: 164.92.216.111 (348), 66.116.226.147 (305), 94.26.106.110 (258)

2. **World-writable API files**: `action-queue.json` and `action-status.json` have 666 permissions
   - Required for CGI script to write
   - Risk assessed as low: only contains action status data, no secrets
   - Mitigated by whitelist validation (only 6 predefined action types accepted)

**Critical Security Gaps:**
- fail2ban NOT INSTALLED
- UFW firewall INACTIVE

**Recommendations:**
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh
```
