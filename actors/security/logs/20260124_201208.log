Running security agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 55,592 total failed attempts (+1,907 since last review) from 1,082 unique IPs
- **Attack Rate**: ~953/hour (increased from 510/hour)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Both direct and URL-encoded attacks are blocked
- **File Permissions**: All correct (CLAUDE.md 664, .ssh 700, SSH key 600)
- **Disk**: 7% usage

The SSH attack rate has nearly doubled since the last review. The fail2ban recommendation remains critical - the system is receiving sustained brute-force attacks from over 1,000 unique IPs. All web protections are functioning correctly.
