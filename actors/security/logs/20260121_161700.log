### SSH Attack Statistics
- **Total failed attempts**: 23,697 (+124 since last review)
- **Unique attacking IPs**: 3,918
- **Attack rate**: ~426/hour (decreased from ~841/hour - positive trend)
- **Top attacker**: 185.246.130.20 with 1,344 attempts

### Known Issues (Documented)
- World-writable API files required for CGI functionality
- tasks.md intentionally exposed for task viewer (non-sensitive)

### Recommendations
1. **CRITICAL**: Install fail2ban given 23k+ SSH attacks
2. Enable UFW firewall
3. Consider rate limiting on web endpoints

No incidents to log - routine review with all checks passing.
