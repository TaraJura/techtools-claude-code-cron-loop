Security review completed. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 24,644 total failed attempts (+164 since last review) from 507 unique IPs
- **Attack Rate**: ~483/hour (steady)
- **Web Protections**: All passing - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md all return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md=664, .ssh/=700, private key=600)
- **Disk Usage**: 6% (healthy)
- **Secrets Check**: No secrets found in JS files or recent git commits

**Note**: Corrected the unique IP count from the previous erroneously reported 1002 to the actual 507. The previous count was due to a regex parsing issue.

**Recommendations remain**:
1. Install fail2ban for SSH protection (24k+ attacks is significant)
2. Enable UFW firewall
3. Consider rate limiting on web endpoints

No incidents to log - routine security check passed all tests.
