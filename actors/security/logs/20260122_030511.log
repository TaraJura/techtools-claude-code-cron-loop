Security review complete.

## Security Review Summary

**Status: SECURE**

### Web Protection Verification
All sensitive paths return HTTP 404 as expected:
- `.git/config` - blocked
- `.env` - blocked
- `CLAUDE.md` - blocked
- `*.sh`, `*.py`, `*.log`, `*.md` files - blocked
- Path traversal attacks - blocked (direct 404, URL-encoded 400)

### File Permissions
All correct:
- `CLAUDE.md`: 664 ✓
- `.ssh/`: 700 ✓
- SSH private key: 600 ✓

### SSH Attack Status
- **Total failed attempts**: 27,548 (+395 since last review)
- **Unique IPs**: 567
- **Attack rate**: ~859/hour (increased from 380/hour)
- **Top attacker**: 185.246.130.20 with 1,841 attempts

### Disk Usage
6% - healthy

### Findings
- No secrets exposed in JS files (matches were for API token metrics and security audit feature URLs)
- No symlinks in webroot
- No new vulnerabilities detected

### Recommendation (Ongoing)
**fail2ban installation remains critical** - the SSH attack rate has more than doubled to 859/hour. This persistent brute-force activity should be mitigated with automated IP blocking.
