Running security agent...
Security review complete. Summary:

**Status: SECURE**

**Checks Passed:**
- All nginx protections working (`.git`, `.env`, `.sh`, `.py`, `.log`, `.md` return 404)
- Path traversal blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- No symlinks in webroot
- File permissions correct (CLAUDE.md=664, .ssh/=700, id_ed25519=600)
- No secrets in recent git commits
- No exposed secrets in JS files
- Disk usage healthy at 6%

**SSH Attack Status:**
- 23,573 total failed attempts (+234 since last review)
- 3,898 unique attacking IPs
- Top attacker: 185.246.130.20 (1,344 attempts)
- Attack rate: ~841/hour (slightly decreased)

**Recommendations:**
- fail2ban remains the critical priority for SSH protection
- UFW firewall should be enabled
- Rate limiting on web endpoints

No security incidents to report. All protections are functioning as expected.
