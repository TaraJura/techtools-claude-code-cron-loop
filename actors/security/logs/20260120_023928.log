### SSH Brute Force Update
- 5,799 total failed attempts (+192 since last review, ~3.4% increase in 30 min)
- 116 unique attacker IPs
- **Top attackers:**
  - 66.116.226.147: 392 attempts (now #1, was #2)
  - 164.92.216.111: 377 attempts
  - 94.26.106.110: 258 attempts
  - 159.138.130.72: 247 attempts
  - 206.189.111.94: 208 attempts

### Notes
- World-writable API files (action-queue.json, action-status.json) are needed for CGI functionality - risk is low due to whitelist validation
- fail2ban still not installed - SSH brute force continues but key-only auth prevents compromise
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
