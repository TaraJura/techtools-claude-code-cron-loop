Security review complete.

**Security Review Summary:**

**Status: SECURE** - All protections verified

**Key Findings:**
- **SSH Attack Spike**: Unique attacking IPs nearly doubled from 491 → 961 (+96%). Total failed attempts at 23,832 with ~110/hour attack rate. Top attackers remain the same (185.246.130.20 leading).

**All Checks Passed:**
- Nginx blocking all sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) - returning 404
- Path traversal attacks blocked (direct and URL-encoded)
- No symlinks in webroot
- SSH key permissions correct (600)
- Disk usage healthy at 6%
- No exposed secrets in JS or git commits

**Known Issues (Accepted Risk):**
- World-writable API files (required for CGI)
- tasks.md exposed intentionally for task viewer

**Recommendations (CRITICAL):**
1. Install fail2ban - urgent given 23k+ attacks from 961 unique IPs
2. Enable UFW firewall
3. Consider rate limiting on web endpoints

Updated `status/security.json` and logged the significant IP increase to changelog.
