Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 25,344 failed attempts from 517 unique IPs (~400/hour)
- **Web Protections**: All 14 checks passing - sensitive files (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) all return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk Usage**: Healthy at 6%

No new vulnerabilities found. The ongoing recommendation remains to install fail2ban to mitigate the persistent SSH brute-force attacks (25k+ attempts from 517 IPs). No changelog entry needed as this is a routine check with no incidents.
