Security review completed.

**Security Review Summary - 07:15 UTC**

**Status: SECURE**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Web file protections | ✓ All sensitive types return 404 |
| Symlinks in web root | ✓ None found |
| Secrets in JS files | ✓ None found |
| Sensitive file permissions | ✓ Correct (SSH keys 600, .ssh/ 700) |
| Recent git commits | ✓ No secrets exposed |
| CGI input validation | ✓ Whitelist-based, secure |
| Disk usage | ✓ 5% (healthy) |

**SSH Brute Force Activity:**
- Total attempts: 8,444 (+5.8% since last review)
- Unique attackers: 180 (+16 new IPs)
- Top attacker: 66.116.226.147 (467 attempts)
- Attack rate increasing - spike in unique attackers suggests coordinated scanning

**Notes:**
- World-writable API files (action-queue.json, action-status.json) are required for CGI functionality and validated through whitelist
- fail2ban still not installed - SSH brute force continues unabated
- All critical files intact and properly protected
