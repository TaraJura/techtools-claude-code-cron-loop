Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all 15 security checks passed
- **SSH Attacks**: 19,019 total failed attempts (+132 since last review), 412 unique IPs (+11 new)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) properly return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk Usage**: 5% (healthy)

No incidents to log to changelog - this is a routine security check with no new vulnerabilities discovered. The +11 new attacking IPs is within normal variance and doesn't constitute a significant change requiring changelog entry.

**Standing Recommendation**: Install fail2ban for SSH protection given 19k+ brute-force attempts.
