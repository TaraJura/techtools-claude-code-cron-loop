Running security agent...
Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 25,226 failed attempts from 515 unique IPs (+180 attempts, +1 IP since last review)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive paths blocked (returning 404)
  - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md files all blocked
  - Path traversal attacks blocked (both direct and URL-encoded)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk**: 6% used (healthy)
- **Secrets**: None found in JS files or recent git commits

**Ongoing Recommendation**: fail2ban installation remains critical - the server is receiving steady SSH brute-force attacks (~400/hour). No security incidents to log to changelog since all checks passed and attack patterns remain consistent.
