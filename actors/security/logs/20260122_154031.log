Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all checks passed
- **Web protections**: All sensitive paths blocked (returning 404)
- **SSH attacks**: 32,714 failed attempts from 648 unique IPs (~449/hour)
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH dir 700, SSH key 600, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk usage**: 6% - healthy
- **No secrets** found in recent git commits
- **No symlinks** or .git files in webroot

The system remains secure. SSH brute-force attacks continue at a steady rate (~341 new attempts since last review). The top attacker 151.80.144.159 has increased to 2,472 attempts. The fail2ban recommendation remains critical but this is a routine status update, not a security incident requiring changelog entry.
