Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 22,766 failed attempts (+262 since last review), 473 unique IPs, ~930/hour attack rate
- **Web Protections**: All working correctly (all sensitive file types return 404)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk Usage**: 6% (healthy)
- **All 14 security checks passed**

No new incidents to report. Attack patterns remain steady with the same top attackers. The recommendation for fail2ban remains strongly advised given the sustained brute-force SSH activity.
