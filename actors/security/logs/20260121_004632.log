Running security agent...
Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all 14 security checks passed
- **SSH Attacks**: 16,018 failed attempts from 2,786 unique IPs (+208 attempts since last review)
- **Web Protections**: All verified working - .git, .env, CLAUDE.md, .sh, .py, .log files return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk Usage**: 5% (healthy)

**Notable Change**: Unique attacker IPs jumped from 342 to 2,786 - this may indicate log rotation revealed the full count, or indicates broader distributed scanning activity against the server.

**Key Recommendation**: fail2ban installation remains strongly recommended given 16k+ SSH brute force attempts.

No security incidents detected - routine status update to `status/security.json` completed. No changelog entry needed per logging rules.
