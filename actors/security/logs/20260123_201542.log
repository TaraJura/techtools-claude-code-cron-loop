- **Top Attackers**: 185.246.130.20 (3,369), 151.80.144.159 (2,547), 66.116.226.147 (840)
- **Web Protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md files all return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md=664, .ssh/=700, SSH key=600)
- **Disk Usage**: 6% (healthy)
- **Secrets in Git**: None found

No incidents to log. The unique IP count discrepancy in the previous review (6,941 vs 897) was due to an incorrect awk field extraction method - corrected in this review using `grep -oP`.
