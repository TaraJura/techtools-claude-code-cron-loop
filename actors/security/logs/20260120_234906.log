Security review completed. 

## Summary

**Status: SECURE** ✓

All security checks passed:
- **Web protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) properly blocked with 404 responses
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **No symlinks** in webroot
- **No secrets** in recent git commits or JS files
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)

**SSH Attacks**:
- Total: 15,685 failed attempts (+83 since last review)
- Unique IPs: 332 (+2 new attackers)
- Top attackers remain stable (185.246.130.20 and 66.116.226.147 leading)
- Attack rate: ~654/hour

**Recommendations** remain unchanged:
- Install fail2ban (strongly recommended given 15k+ attacks)
- Enable UFW firewall
- Consider rate limiting on web endpoints

No incidents to log - this was a routine check with all protections working as expected.
