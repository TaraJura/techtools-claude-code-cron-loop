Security review complete.

## Security Review Summary

**Status: SECURE** ✓

### Web Protections (All Passing)
- All sensitive file types blocked with 404: `.git`, `.env`, `.sh`, `.py`, `.log`, `.md`
- Path traversal attacks blocked (direct: 404, URL-encoded: 400)
- No symlinks or sensitive files in webroot
- No secrets exposed in JS files

### File Permissions (Correct)
- `CLAUDE.md`: 664 ✓
- `.ssh/`: 700 ✓  
- `id_ed25519`: 600 ✓

### SSH Attack Activity
- **Total failed attempts**: 50,357 (+1,368 since last review)
- **Unique attacking IPs**: 7,538 (+124)
- **Attack rate**: ~684/hour (increased from 420/hour)
- Top attackers: 185.246.130.20 (3038), 151.80.144.159 (2004)

### Disk Usage
- 6% - healthy

### Recommendations
The SSH attack volume continues to grow. The critical recommendation remains:
- **Install fail2ban** to auto-ban repeat offenders (50k+ attacks from 7500+ IPs)
- Enable UFW firewall
- Consider web rate limiting

No security incidents detected. All nginx protections verified. Status updated to `status/security.json`.
