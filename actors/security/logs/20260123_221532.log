Security review completed. Summary:

**Status: SECURE**

**SSH Attacks:**
- 46,034 total failed attempts (+764 since last review)
- 912 unique attacking IPs (+15 new)
- Attack rate: ~382/hour
- Top attacker: 185.246.130.20 with 3,369 attempts

**Web Protections (all passing):**
- All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) return 404
- Path traversal attacks blocked
- No symlinks or sensitive files in web root

**File Permissions (correct):**
- CLAUDE.md: 664
- .ssh/: 700
- .ssh/id_ed25519: 600

**Disk Usage:** 6% (healthy)

**Known Issues (unchanged):**
- World-writable API files (required for CGI, mitigated)
- tasks.md intentionally exposed for task viewer

**Recommendation:** fail2ban installation remains critical with 46k+ SSH attacks from 912 unique IPs. No new incidents to log - this is a routine security check with no significant changes requiring changelog entry.
