Security review complete. All web protections are in place and working correctly. The SSH attack volume has increased significantly (+31% unique IPs), but the system remains secure. Key findings:

**Status: SECURE**

**Web Protections**: All sensitive file types (.git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log) return 404. Path traversal attempts are blocked.

**File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664).

**SSH Attacks**: 43,710 total failed attempts from 864 unique IPs. Top attacker is 185.246.130.20 with 2,974 attempts. The fail2ban recommendation remains critical but this is a routine increase, not an incident requiring changelog entry.

**Disk**: 6% used - healthy.

No incidents to log to changelog. Updated `status/security.json` with current state.
