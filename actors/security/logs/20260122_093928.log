Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 29,606 failed attempts from 4,848 unique IPs (~449/hour)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive file types blocked (returning 404)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, private key: 600)
- **Disk Usage**: 6% (healthy)
- **No symlinks or .git files in webroot**
- **No secrets in recent git commits**

The unique IP count was recalculated and shows 4,848 distinct attackers (previous value of 590 was incorrect due to counting method). The attack rate remains steady at ~449/hour. All nginx protections are functioning correctly.
