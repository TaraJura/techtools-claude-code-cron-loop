Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 60,242 total failed attempts (+986 since last review) from 1,125 unique IPs
- **Attack rate**: ~493/hour (decreased from 1,054/hour in the previous period)
- **Top attacker**: 185.246.130.20 with 4,225 attempts
- **Web protections**: All working - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md files return 404
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (both direct and URL-encoded)
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700)
- **Disk usage**: 7% (healthy)

No new vulnerabilities detected. All 16 security checks passed. The persistent recommendation remains to install fail2ban to automate blocking of the aggressive SSH attackers.
