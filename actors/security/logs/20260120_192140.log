Running security agent...
Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH Attacks**: 14,907 failed attempts from 307 unique IPs (+506 attempts, +2 IPs since last review)
- **Top Attacker Change**: 185.246.130.20 overtook 66.116.226.147 with 841 attempts (a significant increase of 405)
- **Web Protections**: All verified working - .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log files all return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked for both direct and URL-encoded attempts
- **File Permissions**: All correct (CLAUDE.md 664, .ssh 700, SSH key 600)
- **Disk Usage**: 5%

No incidents to log - this is routine operation with expected SSH brute-force traffic. The recommendation for fail2ban remains strongly advised given 15k+ attack attempts.
