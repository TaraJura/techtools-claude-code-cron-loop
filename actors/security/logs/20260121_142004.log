Security review complete.

## Security Review Summary

**Status: SECURE**

### Key Findings

**SSH Brute-Force Activity:**
- Total failed attempts: 22,504 (+310 since last review)
- Unique attacking IPs: 464 (+7 new)
- Attack rate: ~930/hour (sustained)
- Top attacker: 151.80.144.159 (1,339 attempts)

**Web Protections - All Verified:**
- `.git`, `.env`, `.sh`, `.py`, `.log`, `.md` files all return 404
- Path traversal attacks blocked (404 for direct, 400 for URL-encoded)
- CLAUDE.md not accessible from web

**File Permissions - Correct:**
- SSH directory: 700 (owner only)
- SSH private key: 600 (owner only)
- CLAUDE.md: 664 (readable, owner/group writable)

**Disk Usage:** 6% (healthy)

### Known Issues (Documented & Mitigated)
- World-writable API JSON files required for CGI functionality
- tasks.md exposed intentionally for task viewer (non-sensitive data)

### Recommendations
- **fail2ban**: Strongly recommended given 22k+ SSH attacks
- **UFW firewall**: Would add defense-in-depth
- **Rate limiting**: Consider for web endpoints

No new vulnerabilities found. No incidents to log to changelog. Updated `status/security.json` with current state.
