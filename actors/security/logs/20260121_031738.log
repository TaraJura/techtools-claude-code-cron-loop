Running security agent...
Security review complete. 

**Summary:**

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Web protections | ✅ All sensitive paths blocked (404) |
| Path traversal | ✅ Blocked |
| File permissions | ✅ Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, SSH key: 600) |
| Secrets in code | ✅ None exposed |
| Disk usage | ✅ 5% |

**SSH Attack Activity:**
- Total failed attempts: 17,154 (+490 since last review)
- Unique attacking IPs: 368 (+21 new IPs)
- Top attacker: 185.246.130.20 (841 attempts)
- Attack rate: ~504/hour

No incidents to report. All 15 security checks passed. The SSH bruteforce attacks continue at a steady rate - fail2ban remains a strong recommendation for automated IP blocking.
