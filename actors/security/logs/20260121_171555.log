Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all checks passed
- **SSH Attacks**: 23,800 total failed attempts from 491 unique IPs (+54 since last review)
- **Web Protections**: All sensitive paths returning 404 (git, env, md, sh, py, log files blocked)
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct and URL-encoded)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (SSH key 600, SSH dir 700, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk Usage**: Healthy at 6%
- **No new vulnerabilities detected**

Attack rate remains stable at ~108/hour, down from the earlier ~426/hour rate. The fail2ban recommendation remains critical given the 23k+ cumulative SSH attacks, but the system is currently secure with no incidents to report.
