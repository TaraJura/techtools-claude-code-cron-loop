Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 46,326 total failed attempts from 916 unique IPs (+292 since last review)
- **Web protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log all return 404
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct 404, URL-encoded 400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md 664, .ssh/ 700, SSH key 600)
- **Disk usage**: 6%
- **Secrets in git**: None found

No incidents to log - this is a routine check with expected attack pattern continuation. The recommendations remain: install fail2ban for SSH protection (46k+ attacks is significant), enable UFW, and consider rate limiting.
