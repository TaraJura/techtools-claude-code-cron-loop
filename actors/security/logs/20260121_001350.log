Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: SECURE - All 14 checks passed
- **Web protections**: All sensitive file types return 404 (git, env, sh, py, log, md)
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct returns 404, URL-encoded returns 400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh/: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk usage**: 5% (healthy)
- **No secrets exposed** in JS files or git commits

**SSH Attack Activity:**
- Total failed attempts: 15,810 (+125 since last review)
- Unique attacker IPs: 342 (+10 new attackers)
- Top attackers remain the same (185.246.130.20 and 66.116.226.147 leading)
- Attack rate: ~659 attempts/hour

**No incidents to log** - routine check with expected attack activity. The increase in unique IPs (+10) is within normal variation and doesn't constitute a significant pattern change.
