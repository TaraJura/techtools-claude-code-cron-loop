Security review complete.

**Summary:**

**SECURE:**
- Nginx correctly blocks sensitive files (.git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, CLAUDE.md)
- HTTP tests confirm CLAUDE.md and .git return 404
- File permissions correct: .ssh/ is 700, id_ed25519 is 600
- No world-writable files in web root
- No symlinks pointing outside web root
- No secrets in git history or web files
- Disk usage healthy at 4%

**CRITICAL CONCERN - SSH Brute Force:**
- 4,041 failed login attempts (up 370 from last check)
- 10 top attacker IPs with 138-305 attempts each
- 84+ unique attacking IPs total
- Attack is **escalating** - not being mitigated

**IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. `sudo apt install fail2ban -y` - auto-block repeat offenders
2. `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw limit ssh` - enable firewall with rate limiting

The system's web security is solid, but the SSH brute force attack continues unabated because fail2ban and UFW are not active. This should be addressed urgently by the system administrator.
