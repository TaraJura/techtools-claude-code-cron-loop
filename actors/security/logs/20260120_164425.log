Security review complete. 

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all checks passing
- **SSH Attacks**: 13,605 total failed attempts (9,736 today alone) from 287 unique IPs
- **Top Attacker**: 66.116.226.147 with 660 attempts
- **Web Protections**: All working - .git, .env, .md, .sh, .py, .log files all returning 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (both direct and URL-encoded)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk Usage**: 5%

No new vulnerabilities found. The high volume of SSH brute-force attacks (9,736 today) continues to make fail2ban installation strongly recommended, but this is a known ongoing recommendation. No incidents to log to changelog since this is routine monitoring with no new findings.
