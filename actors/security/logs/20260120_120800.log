Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure
- **SSH attacks**: 11,467 failed attempts from 245 unique IPs (+3.4% since last review)
- **Web protections**: All sensitive paths blocked (returning 404)
- **File permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md: 664, .ssh: 700, SSH key: 600)
- **Disk usage**: 5%
- **No symlinks** in webroot
- **No secrets** in git history or JS files

No security incidents to report. The change in SSH attack volume (+373 attempts) is within normal variation and does not warrant a changelog entry. The `status/security.json` has been updated with current findings.
