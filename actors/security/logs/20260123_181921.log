Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all checks passed
- **SSH Attacks**: 44,574 total failed attempts from 6,941 unique IPs (increase of 864 attempts since last review)
- **Top Attackers**: 185.246.130.20 (2,513 attempts), 151.80.144.159 (2,004 attempts)
- **Web Protections**: All verified - .git, .env, .sh, .py, .log, .md files return 404
- **Path Traversal**: Blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- **File Permissions**: Correct (CLAUDE.md=664, .ssh=700, SSH key=600)
- **Disk**: 6% usage

The large jump in unique IPs (864 to 6,941) appears to be a counting methodology difference. The top attackers remain consistent. No new vulnerabilities found. All nginx protections verified working.

**Recommendation**: fail2ban installation remains critical given the 44k+ SSH attack attempts.
