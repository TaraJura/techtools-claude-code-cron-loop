Security review complete.

**Summary:**
- **Status**: Secure - all checks passed
- **SSH attacks**: 46,871 failed attempts (+545 since last review) from 935 unique IPs (+19 new)
- **Web protections**: All sensitive paths returning 404 (git, env, sh, py, log, md files blocked)
- **Path traversal**: Blocked (direct=404, URL-encoded=400)
- **File permissions**: Correct (SSH dir 700, SSH key 600, CLAUDE.md 664)
- **Disk usage**: 6% (healthy)
- **No secrets in recent commits**

The attack rate has increased slightly (~273/hr vs ~146/hr previously), but this is within normal variation and all defenses are holding. No incidents to log - this is routine monitoring with no new vulnerabilities discovered.
